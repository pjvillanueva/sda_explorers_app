const L1P3 = 'Perhaps every person has wondered, "Who created the world? Who created humans? Why am I here? Who is God? Where is He? What will happen to the world and the people in it? Why do people sin? How can we know what is right?"';
const L1P4 = 'We will study these questions and many more in this Bible course. In this first lesson, we will learn about "Who created this world and the people in it?"';
const L1P5 = "Now, as we begin this lesson, won't you bow your head in prayer and ask the Lord to make it clear to you?";
const L1S6 = 'CREATION';
const L1Q7 = '1. First of all, who does the Bible say created the world?';
const L1B8 = 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. - Genesis 1:1.';
const L1P9 = 'If only people would believe this statement from the Bible! God made everything.';
const L1Q10 = '2. Who helped in the creation of this world?';
const L1B11 = "God, who in the past spoke to our ancestors in various ways through the prophets, has spoken to us in these last days through His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom He made the world. - Hebrews 1:1, 2.";
const L1P12 = "Jesus helped in the amazing work of creating the world. You see, Jesus lived in heaven with His Father before He came to earth as a baby. He once told His listeners, referring to Himself as the Bread of Life, 'I am the Bread of Life that came down from heaven.' - John 6:51. And in John 17:5, He said, 'And now, Father, glorify Me in Your presence with the glory I had with You before the world began.' You can see why Jesus cares about this world—He helped create it from the beginning.";

const L1B14 = 'And the earth was formless and empty; darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the SPIRIT OF GOD was hovering over the waters. - Genesis 1:2.';
const L1P15 = "You see here that the three persons of the 'Godhead' all united in creating our world. Some might ask, 'But I thought we believe in only one God.' That is true, but our one God is represented by THREE PERSONS: (1) God the Father, (2) God the Son—Jesus, and (3) God the Holy Spirit. These three are united in purpose, work, and plan.";
const L1P16 = "Consider this example: Here is a rope. If I ask you, 'How many ropes do you see?' you would say, 'One.' That is true, but if you look closely, you will see that it is made of three strands, yet it is ONE rope.";
const L1P17 = "Another example: Look at a glowing light bulb. How many lights are there? One. But if you turn off the electricity and examine the inside, you may see three filaments, yet it gives off ONE light. All three Persons in the Godhead in heaven care about us and our salvation.";

const L1P24 = "For nearly a hundred years, many have taught the false idea that the world 'just appeared'; that animal life on earth began millions of years ago and gradually changed until humans emerged.";
const L1P25 = "But that is not what the Bible teaches. The Bible says people will deliberately claim that animals are responsible for their own origins rather than acknowledge that they were created by a Creator (see Romans 1:22,23,25).";

const L1B38 = 'God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. - Genesis 1:16.';

const L1B46 = 'Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. - Genesis 2:7.';
const L1P47 = 'God personally formed Adam from the dust and breathed life into him. Adam was the first man, created in God’s image.';

const L1Q50 = '12. What did God do after He finished creating the world?';
const L1B51 = 'By the seventh day God had finished the work He had been doing; so on the seventh day He rested from all His work. Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it He rested from all the work of creating that He had done. - Genesis 2:2,3.';
const L1B52 = 'Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. - Exodus 20:8.';
const L1P53 = 'After completing creation in six days, God rested on the seventh day and blessed it as a holy day for people to rest and worship Him.';
