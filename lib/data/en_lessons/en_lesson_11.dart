  'L11P3':
      'This lesson is very important because if we want to be saved, we must know what is expected of us. The Word of God tells us this.',
  'L11Q4': '1. What is our whole duty in light of judgment?',
  'L11B5':
      'This is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS, for this is the WHOLE DUTY of man. For God will bring every deed into JUDGMENT. - Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14.',
  'L11P6':
      'We can see in this verse that if we are to be saved, it is our duty to God to keep His commandments.',
  'L11S7': 'THE TEN COMMANDMENTS',
  'L11Q8': '2. Who wrote the Ten Commandments and where were they placed?',
  'L11B9':
      'And He gave Moses... on Mount Sinai, the TWO tablets of the testimony, the STONE TABLETS, WRITTEN WITH THE FINGER OF GOD. - Exodus 31:18.',

  'L11P12':
      'The Ten Commandments are so important that God did not entrust their writing to man. He wrote them with His own finger on stone tablets. Isn’t it amazing to think that God’s own hand wrote the Ten Commandments and gave them to man? They are holy. How dare anyone attempt to change the Ten Commandments?

  'L11B16':
      'Do not think that I CAME TO DESTROY THE LAW or the PROPHETS; I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, UNTIL heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will BY ANY MEANS DISAPPEAR from the LAW until everything is accomplished. Therefore, whoever BREAKS one of the LEAST of these COMMANDMENTS and teaches others to do the same will be called LEAST in the kingdom of HEAVEN. - Matthew 5:17-19.',
  'L11P17':
      'Who dares attempt to abolish the Ten Commandments after Jesus proclaimed this warning? Even the smallest letter or stroke cannot be removed from God’s law as long as heaven and earth remain. Many people say that some commandments are less important than others. Jesus, our Example, kept the commandments and warned that whoever teaches that any of these commandments has been abolished will be considered least in heaven. It is sad that many teach that part of the Ten Commandments has been abolished.',

  'L11S21': 'THE TEN COMMANDMENTS',
  'L11P22':
      'The first four commandments reveal our duty to God. The last six commandments teach our duty to our fellow humans.

      "Whoever commits sin also transgresses the law, for sin is the transgression of the law. -1 John 3:4.",
  "L11P40":
      "The only way to know sin is through the Ten Commandments. Breaking the law is sin, and the wages of sin is DEATH. Therefore, if we want to be saved, we must rely on Christ to help us keep His Ten Commandments. As we draw closer to Jesus, we also draw closer to His laws—His commandments.",
  "L11Q41": "8. If someone obeys Christ’s law, what will they find?",
  "L11B42":
      "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under GRACE. What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not! What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound? Certainly not! -Romans 6:14,15,1,2.",
  "L11P43":
      "If we strive, with Jesus’ help, to obey the Ten Commandments, we will not be punished because 'the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.' -1 John 1:7. In obedience, we will find grace and mercy from Jesus, which we do not deserve. Does that mean that because we are saved by His grace, we can continue breaking any of the Ten Commandments? NO! Paul responds, 'Certainly not!'",
  "L11P44":
      "A man once became enraged and committed a terrible murder. He was sentenced to death. His friends pleaded with the governor to spare his life. They told the governor how good the murderer had been before committing the crime and spoke of his good household. The governor decided to pardon the man and set him free. Does that mean the pardoned man has the freedom to break the law whenever he feels like it? No. He must now be more careful than ever to obey it. Jesus forgave our sins and paid for our death penalty with His blood. So, can we now break the Ten Commandments as we please? Paul says, 'Certainly not!' From now on, we must be more careful than ever to follow His will.",

      "FOR BY GRACE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED through FAITH, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God. -Ephesians 2:8.",
  "L11P47":
      "The Ten Commandments cannot save us; they only show us what sin is. Only the blood of Jesus can save us. We are saved by grace—undeserved mercy. 'It is the gift of God.'",
  "L11P48":
      "Look in a mirror. You see the dirt on your face. Can the mirror wash your face? No. Only soap and water can clean it. (See James 1:23.)

  "L11B50":
      "Blessed is that servant whom his master finds so doing when he comes... Therefore, you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. -Matthew 24:45,44.",
  "L11P51":
      "The end is very near. We must not waste a single day or a single moment. The laws of heaven must be obeyed here on earth just as they will be in heaven. We must decide NOW to follow Jesus all the way so that we will be ready whenever He comes.",
