  'L12T1': 'The Commandment That Most of the World Violates',
  'L12M2':
      'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the SEVENTH DAY is the Sabbath of the Lord your God: in it, you shall not do any work, you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your cattle, nor the stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the SEVENTH DAY. Therefore, the Lord blessed the SABBATH DAY and made it holy. -Exodus 20:8-11.',
  'L12P3':
      'This is a long verse to memorize, but make sure to study it. This is the fourth commandment.',
  'L12P4':
      'In our last lesson, we studied how important it is to follow ALL of the Ten Commandments because if we break one, we become "guilty of all." Jesus said that the Ten Commandments will remain as long as heaven and earth exist. Even though many currently break one of the Ten Commandments, everyone should carefully study it to ensure they are not violating that commandment. If you find that you have broken one of the commandments in the past, you should seek to change and begin following God.',
  'L12P5':
      'If we live by the principle, "I will act as Jesus acted and follow His teachings," we can be sure of our salvation.',
  'L12S6': 'THE SEVENTH DAY IS THE SABBATH',
  'L12Q7':
      '1. Which day of the week did God command to be kept holy?',
  'L12P8': '(See the memory verse above, Exodus 20:8-11).',
  'L12P9':
      'Notice that God requires all men, women, children, and even visitors staying with us to keep the Sabbath day holy. On that day, we are not to do any work.',
  'L12P10':
      'God clearly states which day is the Sabbath—the SEVENTH DAY of the week. Look at any calendar. Which is the SEVENTH and last day of the week? Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish calendars all agree that the day now called Saturday is the SEVENTH DAY of the week and is still called the Sabbath.',
  'L12P11':
      'God requires man to work for six days and rest on the seventh. That is a natural order, isn’t it? Work comes before rest. That is why God gave the last day of the week as the Sabbath.',
  'L12P12':
      'Some people claim that any day of the week is acceptable for rest. They say this because they are unwilling to follow the fourth commandment as God requires. The fourth commandment tells us to keep the SEVENTH day of the week as our Sabbath because after God finished His work of creation, He rested on that day.',
  'L12S13': 'THE SABBATH WAS INTRODUCED IN EDEN',
  'L12Q14':
      '2. Before sin entered the world, which day was kept as the Sabbath in Eden?',
  'L12B15':
      'Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the SEVENTH DAY God finished His work which He had done, and He RESTED on the SEVENTH DAY from all His work which He had done. Then God BLESSED the seventh day and MADE IT HOLY, because on it He rested from all His work that He had created and made. -Genesis 2:1-3.',
  'L12P16':
      'What could be clearer? On Friday evening (the seventh day of the week), God finished His work and rested. He set apart the SEVENTH DAY as the weekly birthday of the world—the SABBATH. "Sabbath" means rest. God rested not because He was tired, but as an example for man. Notice that God rested, blessed, and made the SEVENTH DAY holy. To make something holy means to dedicate it for a sacred purpose. Only God can make a day holy.',
  'L12Q17': '3. Which day will everyone observe in the new earth?',
  'L12B18':
      '"For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make shall remain before Me," says the Lord... "And it shall be that from new moon to new moon, and FROM ONE SABBATH TO ANOTHER, all flesh shall come to worship before Me," says the Lord. -Isaiah 66:22-23.',
  'L12P19':
      'The Sabbath was given before sin entered the world, so it was not abolished at the cross. In the new earth, the true Sabbath of the Bible will be kept by ALL who are saved. Every Sabbath, all people will come to worship before the Lord. If we expect to go to heaven, we should start following heaven’s command now.',
  'L12S20': 'THE TRUE SABBATH',
  'L12Q21': '4. According to the Bible, what is the true "Day of the Lord"?',
  'L12B22':
      'Therefore, the Son of Man is also LORD OF THE SABBATH. -Mark 2:28.',
  'L12P23':
      'Suppose you asked Jesus, "Lord, many people today say that the first day of the week is the Lord’s Day. Others say that all days are the same. Which day do You claim as Your Holy Day?"',
  'L12P24':
      'Jesus would clearly answer so no one is confused, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." Since Jesus is the Creator and made the first Sabbath (see John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:15-16; Hebrews 1:2), we can rightfully call the SEVENTH DAY of the week (Saturday) the true Christian Sabbath.',
  'L12Q25': '5. Which day did Jesus keep?',
  'L12B26':
      'And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And AS HIS CUSTOM WAS, He WENT INTO THE SYNAGOGUE ON THE SABBATH DAY. -Luke 4:16.',
  'L12P27':
      'If you had visited Jesus’ carpenter shop, you would have found it closed every Sabbath, because it was His custom (habit) to go to the synagogue on the Sabbath.',
  'L12P28':
      'The Sabbath is a holy covenant between heaven and earth. If we wait until the first day of the week to worship, we are one day late for "the Sabbath of the Lord your God"—the Sabbath of Jesus.',
  'L12S29': 'A SIGN OR SEAL',
  'L12Q30': '6. What is the Sabbath called?',
  'L12B31':
      'Moreover, I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a SIGN BETWEEN ME AND THEM, that they might know that I am the Lord who SANCTIFIES them. -Ezekiel 20:12.',
  'L12P32':
      'God called the Sabbath a sign; it is a sign between Himself and His people. Soldiers sometimes have a sign that they and the guards recognize, allowing them to enter the camp. The Sabbath is a sign or seal of the Lord. By keeping the Sabbath, we demonstrate our loyalty to God, acknowledging Him as the Creator of heaven and earth. If we refuse to observe the Sabbath, we show disloyalty to the banner of the Ruler of the universe. Would you not find it dreadful to see someone pretending to love our great nation but then taking the flag and trampling it underfoot? Many people claim to love Christ, yet they take His holy sign of sanctification—the SABBATH, the emblem of His being the Creator—and trample it every week. They work, play, shop, and trade on the holy day of God.',
  'L12Q33': '7. How should the Sabbath be observed?',
  'L12B34':
      'If you turn your foot from the Sabbath, FROM DOING YOUR PLEASURE on My holy day... and DO NOT GO YOUR OWN WAY, NOR SEEK YOUR OWN PLEASURE, NOR SPEAK YOUR OWN WORDS: then you shall delight yourself in the Lord. -Isaiah 58:13, 14.',
  'L12P35':
      'How careful we should be in keeping God’s holy day, avoiding our own work or business, refraining from speaking our own words, and not seeking our own pleasure. God never intended the Sabbath to be a public holiday—a day for entertainment and recreation. If the Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, we should not discuss worldly matters. We should not read secular newspapers or listen to the radio, except for religious programs. We should spend the day studying the Bible, praying, and attending church. There is no greater joy than spending the entire day in peaceful walks. The Sabbath should be observed in quietness and a spirit of prayer, and we should attend church whenever possible.',
  'L12P36':
      'Jesus taught that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath. We should care for the sick and perform works of mercy, such as rescuing a stranded animal, visiting the poor, and comforting the discouraged.',
  'L12S37': 'THE SABBATH BEGINS AT SUNSET.',
  'L12Q38': '8. When does a day begin and end?',
  'L12B39':
      'From evening to evening, you shall celebrate your SABBATH. -Leviticus 23:32.',
  'L12P40':
      'Deuteronomy 16:6 tells us that evening begins at "sunset." Christians should observe the Sabbath from sunset to sunset. The first chapter of Genesis states that night comes before day, meaning the Sabbath should be observed from sunset on the sixth day of the week—now called Friday evening—until sunset on the seventh day, or Saturday. How wonderful it is that God’s sunset marks the beginning and end of His holy day, a reminder of creation before sin tainted the world. We cannot change the Sabbath any more than we can change our own birthdate.',
  'L12P41':
      'The Sabbath should be a joyful day of rest from our work and worries—"a day of rest and gladness."',
  'L12Q42': '9. How can we be sure which is the SEVENTH DAY?',
  'L12B43':
      'AND THEY RETURNED AND PREPARED SPICES AND OINTMENTS; AND RESTED THE SABBATH DAY ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT. -LUKE 23:56.',
  'L12P44':
      'Some may tell you that no one knows which day is the SEVENTH DAY Sabbath; however, all major churches agree that Jesus was crucified on Friday and resurrected on Sunday morning. Luke 24 states that the resurrection day was "the first day of the week." The Sabbath, the day between Friday (the preparation day) and Sunday (the first day of the week), is "the Sabbath according to the commandment."',
  'L12P45':
      'Yes, Jesus died for our sins. He died because the Ten Commandments cannot be changed. He also rested on the Sabbath in the tomb and tells us to keep the Sabbath in the new earth. Thousands of people are turning away from the true Sabbath of Jesus—will you be one of them?',
  'L12S46': 'NEXT LESSON',
  'L12P47':
      'Do not let anything hinder you from obtaining your next lesson. You must read it. Who attempted to change the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday? How can we know which is the right day? Will people be lost if they do not keep the Sabbath according to the Bible?'
