  'L13T1': 'The Change of the Sabbath Day',
  'L13M2':
      'Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. - Revelation 14:12.',
  'L13P3':
      'In our last two lessons, we studied how Jesus, through His help, asks us to obey ALL the Ten Commandments. We discovered that the Biblical Sabbath is Saturday, the seventh day of the week, instead of Sunday, the first day of the week, which is now honored by many people.',
  'L13P4':
      'Some say that it is not necessary to keep a specific day holy, but that we should keep every day holy; however, we cannot avoid buying, working, or playing on every day of the week, so it is impossible to keep every day holy.',
  'L13P5':
      'Adam observed the Sabbath before sin entered the world; and Jesus, pure and holy, carefully observed the Sabbath. If Jesus needed to keep the Sabbath, surely we need to keep it as well. And we must certainly keep the same Sabbath that He observed and asks us to keep.',
  'L13S6': 'THE FINAL MESSAGE OF GOD',
  'L13Q7': '1. How does the Bible describe God’s people in the last days?',
  'L13P8':
      '(Refer to the memory verse). The Bible describes God’s people in the last days as those who keep His commandments. The reason is that for many centuries, many Christians have only kept nine of the Ten Commandments. Only in the past hundred years has there been a worldwide movement returning to God and keeping ALL of the Ten Commandments. In Lesson 12, we learned that the world has almost forgotten the fourth commandment, which tells us to keep the seventh day of the week holy.',
  'L13P9':
      'According to prophecy, God’s people in the last days will return to keeping all His commandments, including the fourth. The call to keep God’s true Sabbath (Saturday), the seventh day of the week, is closely connected to the final message that will be given to the world.',
  'L13S10': 'TO THE LAW AND TO THE TESTIMONY',
  'L13Q11':
      '2. If we are disciples of Jesus, what should be our constant guide?',
  'L13B12':
      'Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples... To the law and to the testimony: if they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. - Isaiah 8:16,20.',
  'L13P13':
      'This is a strong statement. If a person teaches a doctrine contrary to the Ten Commandments of God, we should not follow it, for God says that if they do not speak according to the law and testimony (the life and witness of Jesus), there is NO LIGHT in them.',
  'L13P14':
      'The first day of the week is mentioned only eight times in the New Testament, and never is it referred to as the Sabbath or a holy day. The entire Bible teaches the SEVENTH-DAY Sabbath (Saturday).',
  'L13Q15':
      '3. Does it matter to Jesus if we continue to keep Sunday instead of His Sabbath?',
  'L13B16':
      'He answered and said to them, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?... And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men... Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted." - Matthew 15:3,9,13.',
  'L13S17': 'THE CUSTOM OF PAUL',
  'L13Q18':
      '4. Some claim that Paul, the great missionary to the Gentiles, kept Sunday instead of the Sabbath. But what does the Bible say?',
  'L13B19':
      'Then Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures. - Acts 17:2',
  'L13P20':
      'Paul went to church every Sabbath, as was his custom. Aren’t you glad that the Bible speaks clearly about these things so that no one has to be confused?',
  'L13P21': 'Acts 18:4 gives us the same idea:',
  'L13P22':
      'And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded both Jews and Greeks. And on the Sabbath day, we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made. - Acts 16:13.',
  'L13P23':
      'Some will tell you that the Sabbath was no longer observed after the cross. But whenever the Sabbath is mentioned in the New Testament—after Jesus’ death or before— it always refers to the SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH.',
  'L13P24':
      'Some will say that Paul only met with the Jews on the Sabbath, but this is not true. The Sabbath was his day of worship, and he also met with the Gentiles.',
  'L13B25':
      'When the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath... On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God. - Acts 13:42, 44.',
  'L13P26':
      'These verses may not seem important to you now. But when you discuss the Sabbath with your friends and ask them to keep it, they may often say that the Sabbath was only for the Jews. Many believe that the Sabbath was to be kept only until Christ died on the cross. But the New Testament shows that the Sabbath was the only day kept by Jesus and His disciples, and that was the day they taught people to keep. These verses show that Paul kept the Sabbath as the Sabbath instead of Sunday when working with the Gentiles.',
  'L13P27':
      'The Bible records only one meeting that Paul held on the first day of the week—a farewell meeting. (See Acts 20:7,8). This was actually a meeting on Saturday night. No one keeps Saturday night as the Sabbath. In Paul’s time, the day was recognized as beginning at sunset, so the first day of the week actually began at sunset on Saturday night. The holy day that Paul recognized was the Sabbath, the SEVENTH-DAY Sabbath. This was the same day that Jesus gave to man in Eden, included in the Ten Commandments, and the one He commands us to keep in the new earth—the SEVENTH-DAY Sabbath.',
  'L13S28': 'ORIGIN OF SUNDAY OBSERVANCE',
  'L13Q29': '5. How did Sunday observance begin?',
  'L13B30':
      'For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. - Acts 20:29, 30.',
  'L13B31':
      'For the MYSTERY OF LAWLESSNESS IS ALREADY AT WORK… with power, signs, and ASTOUNDING FALSEHOODS… and for this reason, God sends them a delusion so that THEY WILL BELIEVE THE LIE. - 2 Thessalonians 2:7, 9, 11.',
  'L13P32':
      'Paul was deeply concerned that in the future, religious leaders would enter the church, teach false doctrines, and deceive the followers of Jesus. Paul said they were already at work in his days—like ravenous wolves among unsuspecting sheep and goats.',
  'L13P33':
      'As the church grew in power, it also grew in prominence. As it became renowned, it became wealthy and worldly. As it became worldly, its leaders began introducing false doctrines and external customs into the original Christian church. They did this because many had joined the church in name only, while their hearts remained outside. They wanted to hold onto their old beliefs that were condemned by God’s commandments. To gain acceptance, the leaders set aside or altered the Ten Commandments to align with their former beliefs.',
  'L13Q34': '6. Outsiders have worshiped the sun for three thousand years.',
  'L13P35':
      'The Old Testament contains many warnings against sun worship because it was a common practice of those times. (See Deuteronomy 4:19; 17:3; 2 Kings 23:5, 11; Ezekiel 8:16.) People observed great feast days with dancing and drinking in honor of the sun; sometimes, they called these grand celebrations "sun worship." This is where we get our modern word "Sunday." Millions today, though unaware, do not honor God when they worship on Sunday feast days. As faithful Christians learn the truth, they return to God’s true Sabbath, honoring the SEVENTH day according to the Bible. By keeping the fourth commandment, along with the Ten Commandments, they worship God as the Creator of heaven and earth.',
  'L13Q36':
      '7. In A.D. 321, Emperor Constantine of Rome decreed that the entire Roman Empire must observe the first day of the week as a national feast day.',
  'L13P37':
      'All government offices were to close. When he issued this decree, he openly called the first day of the week "the venerable day." He knew that Sunday was a sacred festival where sun worship was practiced.',
  'L13P38':
      'Several years later, during the Council of Laodicea (around A.D. 364), the church officially replaced the Sabbath, shifting it from Saturday to Sunday. Thus, the church and the state joined hands in rejecting the fourth commandment, justifying the change by claiming that observing Sunday honored Christ’s resurrection. However, no person or group has the authority to alter God’s law or sanctify a day. Sunday remains what it was—a preparation day for a man-made festival.',
  'L13Q39':
      '8. For a long time, many could not decide whether to continue observing the Sabbath kept by Jesus or to change, just as many today remain undecided.',
  'L13P40':
      'When you talk to people about observing God’s true Sabbath, the SEVENTH day of the week, they shrug and say, "What difference does it make?" They seem unaware that they will be held accountable for rejecting the Sabbath in light of the Bible’s truth that has come to them, on the day of judgment.',
  'L13P41':
      'For hundreds of years, some observed Saturday, while others observed Sunday, and some even observed both days. But eventually, nearly everyone followed the Roman government and the church in keeping Sunday, a man-made day of worship. It is heartbreaking to realize that the biblical truth Jesus taught—the light of the world—was rejected by hypocritical churches.',
  'L13P42':
      'You may ask, "But how could the church do this?" The church claims to have the authority to change God’s word, even the Ten Commandments, which were written by God’s own finger. Because of this, millions continue to be deceived, keeping Sunday instead of God’s Sabbath. But let us follow Jesus as our guide and not the teachings of men.',
  'L13P43':
      'Christ is deeply disappointed when ministers close their eyes to His Sabbath.',
  'L13B44':
      'Her priests have DONE VIOLENCE TO MY LAW and profaned my HOLY THINGS. They make no distinction between the sacred and the common, nor do they teach the people the difference between the clean and the unclean. THEY HAVE HIDDEN THEIR EYES FROM MY SABBATHS, AND I AM PROFANED AMONG THEM. - Ezekiel 22:26.',
  'L13S45': 'THE RESTORATION OR REFORMATION',
  'L13Q46':
      '9. Nearly four hundred years ago, a great revival took place—a reformation.',
  'L13P47':
      'People began to study the Bible for themselves and follow its teachings instead of the doctrines of false religious leaders. They started preaching, "Back to the Bible and salvation through faith in Jesus." These great men of God brought many important changes to the church, but they did not restore the Sabbath. God did not call them to preach the Sabbath message; instead, He gave them messages for their time regarding other vital biblical truths. These men were not distressed, for according to the prophets, the revival of Sabbath observance and obedience to ALL Ten Commandments would occur in the last days.',
  'L13Q48':
      '10. For hundreds of years, God’s faithful have continued the work of reformation, calling people back to the entire Bible, including the biblical Sabbath.',
  'L13P49':
      'This message of restoration is now being preached in nearly every city worldwide, and thousands are rejecting human traditions to follow God’s commandments.',
  'L13Q50':
      '11. God commands His messengers in the last days to teach people to return to His holy Ten Commandments.',
  'L13B51':
      'Cry aloud, do not hold back, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and DECLARE TO MY PEOPLE THEIR TRANSGRESSION, and to the house of JACOB THEIR SINS... If you TURN AWAY YOUR FOOT FROM THE SABBATH, from doing your pleasure on MY HOLY DAY; then you shall delight yourself in the Lord. - Isaiah 58:1, 14.',
  'L13P52':
      'God calls the Sabbath "MY HOLY DAY." Will you heed God’s call and return to Him in true Sabbath worship, even if others bow to another day? Do not say, "But it’s too hard. People will think I’m strange. I’ll be alone if I change and observe the Sabbath." Remember, soldiers leave behind their fathers, mothers, children, work, and comfortable homes to answer their nation’s call and follow its flag. Will you not do the same for Jesus, who gave everything for you?',
  'L13B53':
      'Jesus, my cross I’ll bear, And I will follow Thee. All things I’ll forsake, Thou art my all to me. - Henry F. Lyte',
  'L13P54': 'Will you make that decision today?'
