  'L14Q5':
      '1. What did Jesus say to His troubled disciples on the night before He was crucified?',
  'L14B6':
      'Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. - John 14:1-3.',
  'L14P7':
      'Jesus told His disciples that He would soon leave them and go to His Father to prepare a place for His people. Then He added, "I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am." Jesus will return to gather His people and bring them to heaven.',

  'L14P11':

  'L14B12':

  'L14S13': 'WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT JESUS’ RETURN?',
  'L14Q14': '3. What will take place when Jesus comes?',

  'L14P16':

  'L14P17':
      'Some say that Jesus has already come. They fail to understand what the Bible teaches about His return. When He comes, the graves of God’s people will open.

  'L14P20':
      'It is frightening to think that many are not preparing for Jesus’ coming. Some consider it unimportant. Others are too busy with daily life and do not take time to prepare. It is sad to know that those who reject or neglect Jesus will not be ready and will be destroyed by the brightness of His coming.',
  'L14P21':

  'L14B24':
      'After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a CLOUD HID HIM from their sight.

His disciples were astonished as they watched Him taken up. Two angels came and comforted them with the promise that "this same Jesus" will return in the clouds, just as they saw Him go.',
  'L14P26':
      'Aren’t you excited that "this same Jesus" will return to earth? Many Old Testament prophecies spoke of Jesus’ first coming, and they were fulfilled literally. The prophecies about His second coming will also be fulfilled literally.',

  'L14P33':
      'The reason why many people will mourn at the coming of Jesus is that they were not prepared for His return. Their sins have condemned them; they are overcome by a guilty conscience; they cannot look at Jesus; they will perish as they behold His glory in His return.',

  'L14P36':
      'No one knows when Jesus will come. Even though we know His coming is near, we must live righteously at all times so that we are always ready.',
  'L14P37':

      'A father who was preparing to leave for a month-long journey was packing his suitcase while his little three-year-old daughter was helping. Suddenly, she stopped and asked, "Why are you packing your suitcase, Daddy?" He answered, "Because I am going on a sea voyage." The child quietly left the room and placed chairs in front of the door. When her father was about to leave, she cried, "Oh Daddy, please don’t take away those chairs; I put them there so you won’t leave Mommy and me. Please don’t leave us."',
  'L14P42':
      'The father carried his daughter and said, "My child, I don’t want to leave you, but I must go. We need to tell others about the coming of Jesus. I will prepare a gift for you and will return to your mother, my love."',
  'L14P43':
      'Do you think that father would leave and never return to his home? Jesus promised, "I will come again and receive you to Myself." He is coming back soon, in just a little while, to take us home with Him. Will you be ready?',
