  'L15T1': 'Is Stealing Always a Sin?',
  'L15M2':
      'For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? - Mark 8:36',
  'L15P3':
      'IMAGINE reflecting on this memory verse for a moment. What joy would you gain if you had everything in this world but lost eternal life? The next verse continues: "Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" Mark 8:37.',
  'L15P4': 'Which will you follow, the + or the \$?',
  'L15P5':
      'A millionaire once said: "I would gladly give a million dollars to have a healthy stomach so I could enjoy eating." How much would the lost people at Jesus’ coming be willing to give if they could trade their wealth for the salvation of their souls?',
  'L15P6':
      'In Pompeii, Italy, you can see the form of a man buried for 1,800 years when Mount Vesuvius erupted. He went back for his chest of gold and jewelry. While clutching them, he died in the scorching ash from the blazing mountain. How tragic—if only he had held on to Jesus instead of his gold.',
  'L15S7': 'DIFFERENT WAYS OF STEALING',
  'L15Q8': '1. What does the eighth commandment say?',
  'L15B9': 'Thou shalt not steal. - Exodus 20:15.',
  'L15P10':
      'That is a clear statement and should be seriously considered by everyone to ensure they fully obey this commandment. There are many ways to steal, aside from robbing a bank or taking an apple or melon from a neighbor. Some steal by looking at a classmate’s exam paper. Stealing knowledge is just as wrong as stealing money. Some steal time from God by breaking the Sabbath.',
  'L15S11': 'INVESTING IN HEAVEN',
  'L15Q12': '2. What should be a Christian’s goal and interest?',
  'L15B13':
      'LAY NOT UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES UPON EARTH, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but LAY UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES IN HEAVEN, where neither moth nor rust corrupts, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: But SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD, and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. - Matthew 6:19, 33.',
  'L15P14':
      'By the way some Christians live, one might think that money and business success matter more to them than anything else. If a Christian lives only for success in this life, then he is the most miserable of all people. We must FIRST seek a place in Jesus’ kingdom, and He will provide everything we need in life.',
  'L15S15': 'ROBBING GOD - OR HONORING GOD',
  'L15Q16': '3. How do many people or Christians rob God?',
  'L15B17':
      'Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? IN TITHES AND OFFERINGS. - Malachi 3:8.',
  'L15P18':
      'Stealing from a neighbor is bad, but stealing from God is even worse. How do we rob Him? He answers, "In tithes and offerings." You would be shocked to hear that a church deacon stole money from the offering plate and put it in his own pocket. But it is just as bad for a Christian to keep God’s tithe for themselves.',
  'L15Q19': '4. What does "tithe" mean?',
  'L15B20':
      'AND ALL THE TITHE of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s: IT IS HOLY UNTO THE LORD... And the tenth part of the herd or of the flock... SHALL BE HOLY UNTO THE LORD. - Leviticus 27:30, 32.',
  'L15P21':
      'The tithe is one-tenth of all profits after deducting wages for helpers and business expenses. For a merchant, the tithe is one-tenth of their earnings or investment profits. By returning the tithe, we acknowledge God as the owner of all things.',
  'L15P22':
      'For example, if you are paid one peso for cutting grass, how much of that belongs to the Lord? Ten centavos, or one-tenth; that is the meaning of "tithe."',
  'L15P23':
      'Besides the tithe, we should also give freewill offerings as the Lord moves our hearts.',
  'L15P24':
      'Perhaps you have never realized that one-tenth of all you receive belongs to the Lord. If you start tithing, you will receive great blessings. You should tithe from all your earnings, even money given to you as a gift. If someone gives you two pesos, twenty centavos of that is holy. Who would dare rob God and use His sacred money for themselves?',
  'L15Q25':
      '5. What warnings and blessings are connected to tithing?',
  'L15B26':
      'YE ARE CURSED WITH A CURSE: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. BRING YE ALL THE TITHES INTO THE STOREHOUSE, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, IF I WILL NOT OPEN YOU THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN, and pour you out a BLESSING, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I WILL REBUKE THE DEVOURER for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground... saith the Lord of hosts. - Malachi 3:9-11.',
  'L15P27':
      'If we withhold God’s sacred tithe, we harm ourselves. Deuteronomy 8:18 says:',
  'L15B28':
      'But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for IT IS HE THAT GIVETH THEE POWER TO GET WEALTH. - Deuteronomy 8:18',
  'L15P29':
      'Since God gives us the strength to work, He has the power to increase our income when we are faithful in giving back to Him. And He has promised to do so. If we faithfully tithe, He will pour out great blessings and rebuke the pests, animals, and anything that would destroy our crops or harm our business.',
  'L15P30':
      'In South America, a faithful Christian owned a large farm. A plague of locusts came and destroyed everything green. This man prayed to God, and when the locusts reached his land, they turned aside and ate everything around it. His farm was miraculously spared by God’s hand, drawing attention from many people miles away. People traveled far to see this wonder, and when they asked the owner how his farm was saved, he read them this passage from Malachi 3 and said: "For years, I have faithfully returned God’s tithe. He promised to protect my crops, and now you see how He has kept His word."',
  'L15S31': 'TITHING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT',
  'L15Q32':
      '6. How does the New Testament explain giving our tithe to God for supporting the gospel work?',
  'L15B33':
      'Do you not know that those who minister in holy things EAT FROM THE TEMPLE OFFERINGS? In the same way, the Lord has commanded that THOSE WHO PREACH THE GOSPEL SHOULD LIVE FROM THE GOSPEL. 1 Corinthians 9:13, 14.',
  'L15B34':
      'Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. THESE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE DONE, without leaving the others undone. -Matthew 23:23.',
  'L15P35':
      'Jesus taught that we should not only give tithe faithfully but also live righteously and not rob God. Tithing has been practiced long before Moses’ time. Abraham gave tithe. (See Genesis 14:19, 20).',
  'L15P36':
      'In temple service, the priests were paid from the tithe. Paul stated that gospel ministers should be paid in the same way. God never intended for a church to run large stores, lotteries, or chicken dinners to raise money for paying ministers. No, the gospel workers should be supported by the sacred funds—the Lord’s tithe. If church members faithfully return their tithe, there will be enough to sustain God\'s work.',
  'L15P37':
      'Have you heard people say, "I really don’t see where the money goes. We can’t meet our needs"? The reason might be that they have neglected God’s house and prioritized their own needs. The Lord says, "Bring all the tithes into the storehouse and test Me now... I will pour out a blessing upon you." He promises to provide for all our needs. Always prioritize giving your tithe, and God will help you with your other expenses.',
  'L15P38':
      'By returning the tithe, you are entering into a partnership with God. If you give Him ten percent of your income, He promises to bless and help you prosper.',
  'L15P39':
      'Some say, "I’ll start tithing when I get out of debt." But the devil hears this and keeps them in debt to prevent them from tithing. If a person starts tithing, they will be amazed at how God blesses them. When Mr. Colgate, a Christian businessman, started his soap business, he decided to dedicate 10% of his earnings to charity. His business flourished, and over the years, his company gave 20 to 30% of its income to charity.',
  'L15Q40':
      '7. An elderly woman living in Mount Kluto, Javea, traveled down the mountain each year carrying in a bag her tithe for an entire year, which she left at the mission. One morning, as she got up, there was a sudden strong tremor and a loud noise. She looked outside just as boiling white elements erupted, ready to destroy everything in their path.',
  'L15P41':
      'Because this trusting woman was faithful to Jesus, she immediately knelt and cried out for protection. The river of molten material split and flowed around her garden, continuing down the mountain... destroying thousands of lives in an instant. But her home was spared, standing like an island amidst the devastation—a testimony that God watches over His humble and faithful children. Will you not fully follow the Lord and begin returning to Him what is His?',
  'L15S42': 'NEXT LESSON',
  'L15P43':
      'Our next lesson will present many amazing points about the life of every boy or girl—"Should I Give Up Other Things for Jesus?" You must take this lesson.'
