  'L16T1': 'Should I Renounce Some Things for Jesus?',
  'L16M2':
      'Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. - 1 John 2:15',
  'L16P3':
      'Some people think that the Christian life is about renouncing many good things they enjoy. However, the Christian life should be full of joy and happiness. David said:',
  'L16B4':
      'You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore. - Psalm 16:11.',
  'L16P5':
      'God has given us this world to enjoy, but He knows best how we can find true happiness. Satan has many deceptions that appear attractive to us. He intends to use them for the destruction of our souls.',
  'L16S6': 'BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES',
  'L16Q7': '1. What is needed for a person to be saved?',
  'L16B8':
      'Let no one despise your youth, but be an EXAMPLE to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in PURITY. - 1 Timothy 4:12.',
  'L16B9':
      'DO NOT SHARE IN OTHER PEOPLE\'S SINS; KEEP yourself PURE. - 1 Timothy 5:22.',
  'L16P10':
      'Paul says that young people should be examples and remain pure in word, in conduct, and in conversation. There is a reason why we must be careful.',
  'L16B11':
      'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. - Matthew 5:8',
  'L16P12':
      'Let us avoid everything that distances us from living a pure life so that we may have eternal life with Jesus.',
  'L16Q13':
      '2. How does John explain what young people should and should not do?',
  'L16B14':
      'I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one. DO NOT LOVE THE WORLD or THE THINGS IN THE WORLD. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. And the WORLD IS PASSING AWAY, and THE LUST OF IT; but he who does THE WILL OF GOD ABIDES FOREVER. - 1 John 2:14-17.',
  'L16P15':
      'Notice each part of these verses. We must be strong. There are many things we cannot do that the world considers right. Evil desires and sinful intentions must be eradicated. The world, along with its pleasures and those who seek them, will perish. But those who accept Jesus as their guide will live forever.',
  'L16P16':
      'The Bible does not explicitly name every sinful pleasure or forbid it by name. Otherwise, the Devil would just change their names. Instead, the Bible provides general principles about what is right and wrong at all times. God did not give us many "do nots" just to enslave us. Rather, He warns us about sinful things to set us free.',
  'L16S17': 'MOVING PICTURES',
  'L16Q18':
      '3. What image of pagan worship did God tell His people to destroy when they entered Canaan?',
  'L16B19':
      'Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and you shall DESTROY ALL THEIR IMAGES. - Numbers 33:52',
  'L16P20':
      'If God commanded them to destroy the images of their time, what would He say about movies today? He did not tell them to destroy only part of them but ALL.',
  'L16P21':
      'One of the most popular entertainments today, which may be more harmful to young people than anything else, is movies. Satan wants to ruin young lives. If he succeeds, he will not have to worry about them later because they are already in his trap.',
  'L16P22':
      'A committee examined 250 films. They found 97 murder scenes, 45 suicides, and 94 other crimes too horrific to mention, all displayed on the screen. Among the actors in these films, 176 were thieves, 25 were immoral women, and 35 were drunkards. Can a person watch these things and still be "pure in heart"? Would we enter such a place?',
  'L16B23':
      'He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to WALK JUST AS HE WALKED. - 1 John 2:6.',
  'L16P24':
      'If we are walking with Jesus, we will not go to places where He would not accompany us. If a person enters a theater, he leaves Jesus and the holy angels at the door, for they will not enter such a place. Who would dare to go in without their protection? The Bible asks:',
  'L16B25': 'Can two walk together, unless they are agreed? - Amos 3:3',
  'L16P26':
      'There are some moving pictures, such as travel documentaries, wildlife films, news, and others, that are not bad when shown in schools or public buildings. But do not go to theaters to see them. The pictures displayed outside a theater already indicate what to expect inside.',
  'L16P27':
      'When deciding where to go and what to do, ask yourself, "What would Jesus do?" You and Jesus must agree on the things you do, the things you watch, and the places you go. You must walk together.',
  'L16S28': 'NOVELS',
  'L16Q29': '4. Who is the originator of all evil schemes and lies?',
  'L16B30':
      'You are of your father the Devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for HE IS A LIAR AND THE FATHER OF IT. - John 8:44.',
  'L16P31':
      'Novels and serialized histories are closely related to movies. Most novels and historical readings are about murder, evil desires, and lies. Jesus says that Satan is the father and initiator of all falsehoods.',
  'L16P32':
      'A person who enjoys reading novels and immoral love stories or murder tales is not only in a bad state now but will also be left outside of heaven.',
  'L16B33':
      'Blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city through its gates. OUTSIDE are the... MURDERERS, IDOL WORSHIPERS, and EVERYONE WHO LOVES AND PRACTICES FALSEHOOD. -Revelation 22:14, 15.',
  'L16P34':
      'Reading novels makes life unreal and often leads to impure thoughts. If a person reads meaningless books and stories, their mind will become confused, making it difficult to enjoy good reading.',
  'L16P35':
      'Many homes today need a fire to burn books and reading materials. (See Revelation 19:18,19.)',
  'L16P36':
      'Listening to novels and fictional stories on the radio or television is just as bad as reading them.',
  'L16S37': 'SONG',
  'L16Q38': '5. What should be our standard regarding songs?',
  'L16B39':
      'Teach and admonish one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God. -Colossians 3:16.',
  'L16P40':
      'No Christian should play lively music, obscene or explicit love songs. Some secular songs are acceptable for a Christian, such as old traditional folk songs. There are also some beautiful new songs. If you pray to Jesus and ask Him for guidance, He will help you choose the right songs.',
  'L16S41': 'DANCING',
  'L16Q42':
      '6. What should we do when we encounter something immoral in entertainment?',
  'L16B43':
      'Beloved, I urge you as strangers and sojourners to ABSTAIN FROM FLESHLY LUSTS WHICH WAGE WAR AGAINST THE SOUL. You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, God’s special possession. -1 Peter 2:9, 11.',
  'L16P44':
      'Among the pleasures people hold on to, dancing is one of the most dangerous. God’s people should be distinct, holy, and pure, having nothing to do with immoral entertainment. A renowned dance instructor once said that dancing has led more women to sin than any other form of amusement. Thousands of homes have been broken because of dancing. Women, if you want to remain pure, do not learn to dance.',
  'L16P45':
      'Men, Jesus would never be found dancing. We should "walk as He walked."',

  'L16P49':
      'Playing cards at home may seem harmless. However, remember that most gamblers learned to play cards at home before they dared to gamble outside.',
  'L16Q50': '8. What does the Bible say about wearing jewelry?',
  'L16B51':
      'Likewise, that women should adorn themselves in modest apparel... NOT with braided hair, GOLD, PEARLS, or EXPENSIVE CLOTHES. -1 Timothy 2:9.',
  'L16B52':
      'Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair, the wearing of GOLD JEWELRY, or putting on fine clothes. -1 Peter 3:3.',
  'L16P53':
      'Yes, Christians should dress differently from worldly people. Jesus expects us to dress neatly and modestly. He asks His followers not to wear jewelry. When Jacob called his household to come to God, they discarded all their jewelry (Genesis 35:4). God commanded the Israelites to remove all their ornaments at Horeb (Exodus 33:5,6). As we prepare for Jesus’ coming, we must renounce these things and live modestly and humbly in these last days.',
  'L16S54': 'SPEECH',
  'L16Q55': '9. What kind of speech should we use?',
  'L16B56':
      'And whatever you do in WORD or deed, do everything in the NAME OF THE LORD JESUS. -Colossians 3:17.',
  'L16B57':
      'Finally, brethren, whatever is TRUE, whatever is HONORABLE, whatever is JUST, whatever is PURE... think about these things. -Philippians 4:8.',
  'L16P58':
      'As Christians, we should reject not only cursing but also rude, evil words, obscene stories, and joking about sacred matters. The Bible says that those who will be saved will have "no lie found in their mouths." -Revelation 14:5.',
  'L16S59': 'RECREATION AND ENJOYMENT',
  'L16Q60': '10. What recreational activities can people engage in?',
  'L16P61':
      'There are many enjoyable activities for Christians, such as indoor games, tennis, basketball, golf, volleyball, and badminton. Outdoor activities like boating, swimming, hiking, and cycling are excellent pastimes. You can also enjoy social gatherings like dinner feasts or outdoor picnics and campfires.',
  'L16P62':
      'Many interesting hobbies include carpentry, leather crafting, photography, gardening, pottery, studying nature, stamp collecting, and more.',
  'L16P63':
      'Wholesome and clean recreation is a blessing to every young Christian.'
