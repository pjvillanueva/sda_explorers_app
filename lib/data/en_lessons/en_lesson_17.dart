  'L17T1': 'The Day of Judgment - How Close Are We?',
  'L17M2':
      'And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation, tribe, language, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea, and the springs of water. - Revelation 14:6,7',
  'L17P3':
      'This is a long passage to memorize and will count as two points on your review paper. It is a prophetic message given in the last days before the end, announcing that the judgment has already begun in heaven. This message will spread to every nation in the world.',
  'L17P4':
      'In this lesson, we will study the work and timing of the judgment. We will see that judgment is real, it includes all of us, and there is no time to waste in preparing for it.',
  'L17S5': 'AN APPOINTED DAY',
  'L17Q6': '1. How many will face judgment?',
  'L17B7':
      'For WE MUST ALL appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. - 2 Corinthians 5:10.',
  'L17P8':
      'That is why you and I should be interested in the judgment because we are all included.',
  'L17B9':
      'For HE HAS APPOINTED A DAY on which He will judge the world in righteousness. - Acts 17:31.',
  'L17P10':
      'Clearly, even in Paul’s time, a specific date was set in prophecy for the beginning of judgment. This happens some time before Jesus returns.',
  'L17P11':
      'According to the exciting prophecy in Daniel 7, 8, and 9, a great investigation of the record books that contain human deeds has already begun in heaven. This is called the "Cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary." According to prophecy, it began in the year 1844 A.D. This date, 1844, is one of the strongest prophetic points in the Bible. Since then, the judgment in heaven has been ongoing. At that time, the books in heaven were opened, and the review of human life records began.',
  'L17P12':
      '(This study on Daniel 8 and 9 is fully covered in "The Faith Bible Course" and in our advanced Bible course on the prophecies of "Daniel and Revelation." Enroll in these courses after completing this one.)',
  'L17Q13': '2. How did Daniel describe the beginning of this solemn judgment?',
  'L17B14':
      'I watched till thrones were put in place, and the Ancient of Days was seated; His garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was a fiery flame, its wheels a burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him. A thousand thousands ministered to Him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. THE COURT WAS SEATED, AND THE BOOKS WERE OPENED. - Daniel 7:9,10.',
  'L17P15':
      'The judgment began, and the books were opened as God the Father took His place to preside.',
  'L17Q16':
      '3. Who is our defender (mediator), our helper, and our friend in the heavenly judgment?',
  'L17B17':
      'And if anyone sins, we have an ADVOCATE with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. - 1 John 2:1.',
  'L17B18':
      'For we do not have a HIGH PRIEST who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who was in all points TEMPTED AS WE ARE, yet without sin. - Hebrews 4:15.',
  'L17B19':
      'Therefore, He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him since He always lives to make intercession for them. - Hebrews 7:25.',
  'L17P20':
      'These words are crystal clear! Jesus is the one who redeems us from sin. Jesus, who was tempted in all ways as we are, serves as our High Priest in the heavenly court. Jesus can save to the utmost. Jesus lives to intercede (plead for forgiveness) on our behalf. Oh, let us never turn away from Jesus, for He is our Savior, our heavenly Redeemer, and our only hope.',
  'L17S21': 'THE RECORD BOOKS OF HEAVEN',
  'L17Q22': '4. From what record will people be judged?',
  'L17B23':
      'And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before the throne, and BOOKS WERE OPENED. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were JUDGED ACCORDING TO THEIR WORKS, by the things which were written in the books. - Revelation 20:12.',
  'L17P24':
      'Judgment started with those who lived first in human history. Once the record of the dead is reviewed, the court will move on to those who are still alive. What a solemn thought— "judged according to the things written in the books, according to their works." Our guardian angels record every thought and every action of our lives. What does the record of your life look like in the pages of the heavenly books?',
  'L17Q25':
      '5. Where are the names of those who became God’s children recorded?',
  'L17B26':
      'Yes, I ask you also... to help these women who LABORED WITH ME... WHOSE NAMES ARE IN THE BOOK OF LIFE. - Philippians 4:3.',
  'L17P27':
      'The most important book in the universe, next to the Bible, is the Book of Life. When a person gives their heart to Jesus and commits to following Him completely, their name is written in the Book of Life.',
  'L17P28':
      'It is a wonderful thing to have your name recorded in that book because:',
  'L17B29':
      'And anyone NOT FOUND WRITTEN in the BOOK OF LIFE was CAST INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE. - Revelation 20:15.',
  'L17P30':
      'How sad that many people do not make the commitment to stand for Jesus and have their names written in the Book of Life. How sad that many who started following Jesus gave up too soon. Unless they return to Jesus, He will erase their names from the Book of Life. (See Revelation 3:5)',
  'L17Q31': '6. How careful is the examination of each life?',
  'L17B32':
      'And I tell you, that EVERY IDLE WORD that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of JUDGMENT. -Matthew 12:36.',
  'L17B33':
      'Rejoice, O young man, in your youth: and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes; but know that FOR ALL THESE THINGS GOD WILL BRING YOU INTO JUDGMENT. -Ecclesiastes 11:9.',
  'L17P34':
      'How often do people say, "I just want to have a good time. I don’t know why I can’t do this or that. Why should a person be careful? You’re only young once. What difference does it make what I do?" Oh, in judgment, this is the great difference in the world. And no one will regret living a careful life. Every young person will truly be grateful that they rejected sinful pleasures, idle talk, disobedience, and impure thoughts.',
  'L17Q35': '7. Why do some love darkness and fear the light of Jesus?',
  'L17B36':
      'Men loved darkness rather than light, BECAUSE THEIR DEEDS WERE EVIL. -John 3:19.',
  'L17P37':
      'If people do something they know is wrong, they don’t want to be seen doing it "because their deeds are evil." Many will wish on the day of judgment that their sinful lives remained hidden, but the light of Jesus will reveal every secret sin.',
  'L17P38':
      'A prison guard in the East once said, "Many hardened criminals who deny any wrongdoing confess their crimes at the last moment before they die in the electric chair. They seem to fear death in judgment."',
  'L17S39': 'THE END OF JUDGMENT',
  'L17Q40': '8. With what solemn statement will the judgment end?',
  'L17B41':
      'Let the UNRIGHTEOUS STILL BE UNRIGHTEOUS: and let the filthy still be filthy: and let the righteous still be righteous: and let the holy still be holy. BEHOLD, I COME QUICKLY, AND MY REWARD IS WITH ME, to give every man according to his work. -Revelation 22:11, 12.',
  'L17P42':
      'The great day of judgment began in 1844. It is significant and exciting to note that before 1844, many great men from different denominations started preaching about judgment and the end of the world. This message is more important now than ever before and is currently being preached worldwide. The work of judgment in heaven has been ongoing since 1844. As each name is presented before God, the deeds of every life are reviewed, and judgment is given accordingly.',
  'L17P43':
      'The time of King Saul came. He was once a follower of God, but later decided that obedience was no longer necessary. "Blot out his name from the Book of Life," was the command from heaven.',
  'L17P44':
      'Then came the names of David and Peter. Records of all their mistakes, sins of impurity, cursing, and more were present. But Jesus pleaded, "My Father, they have repented and confessed their sins. Save them for My sake." The heavenly decision was made: "They shall be saved."',
  'L17P45':
      'All signs show that the end is very near, and soon Jesus will declare: "It is finished. The filthy will remain filthy... the holy will remain holy. Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give every man according to his work."',
  'L17P46':
      'Your name will come up in judgment one of these days. If your life is placed on the scales, how will it measure up? How will your record appear? Are you living daily for Jesus? Have you repented of your sins so they may be covered by the blood of Jesus? Soon, the last name will be considered. How will your record be revealed?',
  'L17S47': 'IS MY NAME WRITTEN?',
  'L17B48':
      'Lord, I do not seek gold or silver, My only desire is salvation; In the beautiful pages of Your precious book, Jesus, is my name written? - As numerous as the sand, my sins before You But Your blood is enough to wash me clean; For You promised that though my sins be as scarlet, You will make them white as snow. In the beautiful pages of Your precious book, Jesus, is my name written? - Mrs. M.A. Kidder -',
  'L17S49': 'NEXT LESSON',
  'L17P50':
      'Our next lesson is exciting for every young person, "God’s Health Principles for Christians – What Are They?" Will we be lost if we do not follow them? Study this lesson carefully for yourself.'
