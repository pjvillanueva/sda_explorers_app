  'L18T1': 'God’s Health Principles for Christians',
  'L18M2':
      'If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is sacred, and you are that temple. - 1 Corinthians 3:17',
  'L18P3':
      'We all admire young people with strong bodies. We admire the fastest runners, the fastest swimmers, and those who can jump the highest. The body requires more careful attention than the finest watch or the most valuable bicycle.',
  'L18P4':
      'Some people say that God does not care what a person eats or drinks. Sometimes they say, "I think what I eat is my own concern and has nothing to do with my religion." As we look into God’s Word, it is surprising to see how much guidance is given regarding food and health. As we study these instructions, let us not see them as "restrictions" but as safe warnings for our health.',
  'L18S5': 'GOD’S CONCERN FOR OUR HEALTH',
  'L18Q6': '1. Who deeply cares about our health and the care of our bodies?',
  'L18B7':
      'Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit?... and YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN? For you were bought at a price; therefore, GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY. - 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20.',
  'L18P8':
      'We do not own ourselves to do as we please. Jesus died for our sins. When we surrender our hearts and lives to Him, we belong to Him from then on. He dwells in us; we become His temple on earth.',
  'L18P9':
      'Every young person would think it is terrible to bring something filthy into a church. It is just as wrong for us to bring into our bodily temple anything that God calls unclean.',
  'L18Q10': '2. Why is God concerned about our diet and lifestyle habits?',
  'L18B11':
      'Beloved, I PRAY that in all things you may prosper and be in good health, JUST AS YOUR SOUL PROSPERS. - 3 John 2.',
  'L18P12':
      'Soldiers, sailors, and marines are carefully trained in the best ways to develop strong bodies. Likewise, Christ’s soldiers must keep their bodies in the best possible condition. If we want to be quick in spiritual matters, we must have healthy bodies. We must advance both physically and spiritually—in health and in heart.',
  'L18Q13':
      '3. What concern has God shown for human food from the very beginning?',
  'L18B14':
      'And God said, "Behold, I HAVE GIVEN YOU every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth, and every tree that has fruit with seed in it; they will be yours for food." - Genesis 1:29',
  'L18P15':
      'God gave humans fruits, nuts, grains, and vegetables for food. He only permitted the use of meat after the flood—about 850 years before Moses’ law was given. A plant-based diet including vegetables, milk, eggs, fruits, grains, and nuts is still the best for humans. Animals have become more diseased, making meat consumption even more dangerous today than in biblical times.',
  'L18S16': 'FORBIDDEN MEATS',
  'L18Q17': '4. What distinction does God make between different animals?',
  'L18B18':
      'Of every CLEAN ANIMAL, take seven pairs, male and female; and of every UNCLEAN ANIMAL, take one pair, male and female. - Genesis 7:2',
  'L18P19':
      'The Bible classifies all animals, birds, and sea creatures into two categories: (1) clean, which may be eaten as food; (2) unclean, which are strictly forbidden as food. This distinction was so important that when God called His chosen people, Israel, He instructed Moses to carefully list for them the clean and unclean meats. The unclean birds were listed by species. You can find these lists in two Bible chapters, Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14.',
  'L18P20':
      'Sea creatures are only edible if they have fins and scales. This is why followers of Jesus should not eat crabs, shrimp, eels, or lobsters, as they have neither fins nor scales. (See Leviticus 11:9)',
  'L18Q21': '5. What law was given regarding four-legged animals?',
  'L18B22':
      'Any animal that has a SPLIT HOOF COMPLETELY DIVIDED and CHEWS THE CUD may be eaten... And the rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you. And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. - Leviticus 11:3, 6, 7.',
  'L18P23':
      'If an animal has a completely divided hoof and chews the cud, like a cow or deer, it is permissible to eat. If it does not meet both criteria, it is forbidden by God. For example, the rabbit chews the cud but is forbidden. This is why Christians should not eat ham or pork in any form or cook with its fat. The Bible declares these as unclean.',
  'L18P24':
      'Pork is one of the most dangerous meats. It often contains tiny parasites that cause a disease called "trichinosis," leading to heart disease, cramps, serious intestinal issues, and even mental disorders.',
  'L18P25':
      'How grateful we should be that God has not hidden these truths from His people. He knows the nature of every animal and the risks their meat poses. In His love, God warns us not to eat unclean animals.',
  'L18Q26':
      '6. What solemn warning does God give to Christians in the last days about avoiding forbidden foods?',
  'L18B27':
      'See, the LORD IS COMING with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; to execute his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire. Those who sanctify and purify themselves, who go into the gardens following one in their midst, who EAT PORK, detestable things, and rats, shall ALL COME TO AN END together, declares the LORD. - Isaiah 66:15, 17.',
  'L18P28':
      'Our memory verse tells us that if anyone defiles his bodily temple, God will destroy him. This passage shows that the prohibition against eating pork and other unclean animals remains in effect until Jesus returns.',
  'L18S29': 'HARMFUL HABITS',
  'L18Q30': '7. What else does God forbid?',
  'L18B31':
      'Lest there be among you a ROOT THAT BEARETH POISONOUS FRUIT and wormwood. The LORD WILL NOT PARDON HIM, but rather the anger of the LORD and His jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curses written in this book shall rest upon him, and THE LORD WILL BLOT OUT HIS NAME FROM UNDER HEAVEN. -Deuteronomy 29:18, 20.',
  'L18P32':
      'God will not save those who disobey His will in matters such as using a "poisonous root." Yet many poisons are freely used by many Christians.',
  'L18P33':
      '(1) Tobacco contains many poisons, but the most severe is nicotine. It damages the heart, lungs, stomach, throat, and nerves, and clouds the mind. That is why the best athletes refuse to use tobacco. They know that tobacco will destroy anyone who wants a strong body.',
  'L18P34':
      '(2) Tea contains the poison theine. That is why it strongly affects the nerves when someone tries to quit drinking it. Never start.',
  'L18P35':
      '(3) Coffee. How many have ruined their nerves, if not their hearts, by drinking coffee? Its poison, caffeine, wreaks havoc on countless Christians who seem unaware that by defiling their bodily temple, they are sinning against Him.',
  'L18P36':
      '(4) Some types of cola drinks are almost as dangerous as coffee. They contain harmful stimulants. That is why tired people crave cola drinks. To sell more of these cola drinks, their manufacturers try to hide the fact that they contain poisons.',
  'L18Q37': '8. What else is wrong with consuming harmful foods and drinks?',
  'L18B38':
      'WHY DO YOU SPEND MONEY FOR THAT WHICH IS NOT FOOD? And your labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen diligently to Me, and eat that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. -Isaiah 55:2.',
  'L18P39':
      'It is a sin to waste money on harmful things like tobacco, tea, coffee, and colas. More money is burned in tobacco smoke than is spent on all churches, church schools, and orphanages combined. Let us not waste any of our money on Satan’s poisons.',
  'L18S40': 'WARNINGS AGAINST ALCOHOL',
  'L18Q41':
      '9. What warning is given against drinking alcohol in any form, such as wine, beer, and gin?',
  'L18B42':
      'WINE IS A MOCKER, strong drink is raging, and WHOEVER IS DECEIVED THEREBY IS NOT WISE. -Proverbs 20:1.',
  'L18B43':
      'But take heed to yourselves, LEST YOUR HEARTS BE WEIGHED DOWN with dissipation, DRUNKENNESS, and the cares of this life, and THAT DAY COME UPON YOU SUDDENLY LIKE A TRAP. -Luke 21:34.',
  'L18P44':
      'Those who drink, even in moderation, will be caught off guard at Jesus’ coming. It will be too late for them to change.',
  'L18S45': 'LIVING FOR JESUS',
  'L18Q46': '10. What appeal does God make to His followers in the last days?',
  'L18B47':
      'Therefore, whether you EAT OR DRINK, or whatever you do, DO ALL TO THE GLORY OF GOD. -1 Corinthians 10:31.',
  'L18B48':
      'We know that when He appears, WE SHALL BE LIKE HIM: for we shall see Him as He is. And everyone who has this hope in Him PURIFIES HIMSELF, just as He is pure. -1 John 3:2, 3.',
  'L18B49':
      'Therefore, COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM AND BE SEPARATE, says the Lord, and DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN, and I will receive you. -2 Corinthians 6:17.',
  'L18P50':
      'We cannot eat forbidden foods and drink forbidden beverages and live to the glory of God. If we want to be saved, we must be as physically pure as Jesus. We should never touch anything unclean or forbidden.',
  'L18S51': 'NEXT LESSON',
  'L18P52':
      'Surely, everyone wants to receive the next lesson, "The End of the World." What will happen when the end comes? What will happen to everyone in this world? What will happen to Satan? What is "the abyss?"'
