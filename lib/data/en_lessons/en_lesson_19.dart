  'L19P22':
      'During the thousand years in heaven, the righteous will examine the records and see why various people were not saved. Some whom they thought were very good are missing. A person may have held on to some secret sin; perhaps some thought they did not need to keep ALL TEN COMMANDMENTS.

He will be left to reflect on the consequences of his terrible rebellion.',
  'L19P26':
      'On that day, Satan will remember some of you. He will recall how he tempted you and how sometimes he made you feel that you could not give up certain things for Jesus—that you could not obey His commandments.
