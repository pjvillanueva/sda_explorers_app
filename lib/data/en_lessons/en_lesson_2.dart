const L2P3 =  
    'In our last lesson, we studied the origin of man. Every task must have someone to do it, and it requires a worker. Therefore, everything was created. The One who created all things—the Creator of the earth, plants, animals, humans, etc.—is whom we call God.';  
const L2P4 =  
    'A famous radio broadcaster once wrote about how he began his search for the truth. He said: "Every car comes with a manual. Surely, the Creator of this world would not leave it without guidance on how people should live and what is expected of them."';  
const L2P5 =  
    'Yes, our Creator has given us a Guidebook—a book of instructions—the Holy Scriptures. That book will be the foundation of all our studies.';  
const L2Q6 = '1. Who wrote the Holy Scriptures?';  
const L2B7 =  
    'No prophecy of Scripture came from personal interpretation. For prophecy never came by human will, but men spoke from God as they were moved by the HOLY SPIRIT. - 2 Peter 1:20-21';  
const L2P8 =  
    'There are sixty-six books in our Holy Scriptures, written by many authors—men who lived in different lands, hundreds of years apart—yet their writings are unified, as they wrote what was revealed through the Holy Spirit.';  
const L2P9 =  
    'Since the Holy Spirit guided the writing of the Holy Scriptures, it is, in fact, harmoniously unified, even though different parts were entrusted to different men. The Holy Scriptures are so important that when Jesus was on earth, He frequently quoted from the writings of the prophets. Jesus did not have the New Testament to base His teachings on, so He always quoted from the Old Testament.';  
const L2Q10 =  
    '2. What did Jesus say about the importance of the Scriptures—the Bible?';  

const L2B11 =  
    'Search the Scriptures, for you think that in them you have ETERNAL LIFE; and these are they which TESTIFY ABOUT ME. - John 5:39.';  

const L2P12 =  
    'Therefore, the Holy Scriptures are our guide to eternal life. That is why we should eagerly study the Word of God—to learn how we can have eternal life with Jesus.';

const L2B17 =  
    'All Scripture is INSPIRED BY GOD and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness; so that the people of God may be complete. - 2 Timothy 3:16-17.';  

const L2P18 =  
    'Take note of the word ALL. Everything in the Holy Scriptures is inspired by God. It teaches you the right way to live. The Holy Scriptures provide us with the complete picture of life. Removing any part of it distorts the picture.';

    '5. What challenge does God give to anyone who claims divine authority?';  

const L2B20 =

const L2P22 =

const L2P23 =  
    'None, for there is confusion everywhere outside of the Holy Scriptures. Only the Holy Scriptures can tell us (a) who created the world and (b) where we are headed. Only the Holy Scriptures can provide the complete picture of humanity’s future. No wonder God invites us: "Look unto Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else." Only the Holy Scriptures can lead us to the Savior.';

    'PROPHECIES PROVE THAT THE HOLY SCRIPTURES ARE INSPIRED';  

const L2P26 =  
    'It is not difficult to prove that the Holy Scriptures were written by God, who alone knows the future, rather than by man. Time and again, God instructed the prophets to write down future events so that when they happened, people would know that God had revealed them beforehand. Let us study some of the amazing historical fulfillments of prophecy.';  

const L2Q27 =

const L2B28 =  
    'And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. IT WILL NEVER BE INHABITED AGAIN, NOR WILL IT BE LIVED IN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION; NOR WILL THE ARABIANS PITCH THEIR TENTS THERE, NOR WILL SHEPHERDS LET THEIR FLOCKS LIE DOWN THERE. Instead, WILD BEASTS of the desert will lie there, and OSTRICHES will dwell there. - Isaiah 13:19-21.';  

const L2B29 =  
    'And Babylon will become HEAPS OF RUINS—FORSAKEN AND WITHOUT INHABITANTS. This is what the Lord of Hosts says: The thick walls of Babylon will be COMPLETELY TORN DOWN, and its HIGH GATES WILL BE BURNED WITH FIRE. - Jeremiah 51:37,58.';  

const L2P30 =  
    'The Babylonians thought that Babylon would never fall. Its massive stone walls were more than 300 feet thick. The city had powerful fortifications, but the humble prophets wrote down the messages God had spoken, and every single word came true. No historical record compares to the Holy Scriptures. Let us examine what happened to Babylon:';  

const L2I31 =
    'a. When he was attacked after many years as foretold in prophecy, his great fortress was crushed.';
const L2I32 = 'b. The city of Babylon was destroyed by fire.';
const L2I33 =
    'c. It remains desolate—it has not been rebuilt and will not be rebuilt.';
const L2I34 = 'd. No one dwells there.';
const L2I35 =
    'e. Wild animals and birds inhabit the ruins of what was once a great city.';
const L2I36 =
    'f. The proud Babylonians are no more; wandering Arabs do not pitch their tents there.';
const L2I37 =
    'g. However, no matter how much travelers offer to the people of Arabia, they refuse to spend even a single night in the ruins of Babylon.';
const L2P38 =
    'If anyone reads these astonishing prophecies and their remarkable fulfillment, would they still doubt the Holy Scriptures?';
const L2Q39 =
    '7. More than a hundred years before Cyrus was born, what did the Lord say he would do?';
const L2B40 =
    'Thus says the Lord to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to SUBDUE NATIONS before him... To OPEN the gates before him, and the city gates shall not be shut; I will go before you and level the rough places, I will SHATTER THE BRONZE GATES and cut through the IRON BARS. - Isaiah 45:1-2.';
const L2P41 =
    'Here is the description of how Cyrus, king of Media and Persia, would attack the city of Babylon. And now, let us look back at what happened.';
const L2I42 =
    'a. He diverted the Euphrates River (which flowed under the outer wall, through the middle of the city of Babylon) from its usual course, and when the ancient river dried up, his troops entered under the outer wall.';
const L2I43 =
    'b. That night, the king of Babylon, Belshazzar, and his top officials were drunk. And while the guards were also intoxicated that night, they forgot to close the inner gates of the wall, allowing Cyrus’ troops to enter the city and capture it.';
const L2I44 =
    'c. He destroyed the bronze gates and took the city’s gold and silver.';
const L2P45 =
    'And REMEMBER, God told Isaiah to write all these things more than a hundred years before Cyrus was even born and called him by name. Surely, then, no one can doubt the wisdom of believing in the Word of God.';
const L2S46 = 'THE WORD OF GOD IS OUR ONLY SAFETY AND GUIDE.';
const L2Q47 =
    '8. In these critical times, as we face the future, what can we be sure of?';
const L2B48 =
    'Surely, the Lord God does nothing without REVEALING His secret to His SERVANTS, THE PROPHETS. - Amos 3:7.';
const L2P49 =
    'It is a wonderful comfort to know that God knows what is to come; He has revealed these events through the prophecies in the Holy Scriptures.';
const L2Q50 =
    '9. Why have these past events and God’s visions of the future been carefully recorded in the Holy Scriptures?';
const L2B51 =
    'These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come. - 1 Corinthians 10:11.';
const L2P52 =
    'We should be grateful for the Holy Scriptures because they explain the past, help us understand the present, and provide us with advice, reminders, hope, and comfort for the future.';
const L2Q53 =
    '10. What do we have today that is stronger than armies and sharper than swords?';
const L2B54 =
    'For the WORD OF GOD is LIVING and POWERFUL, and SHARPER than any two-edged SWORD, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit—and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. - Hebrews 4:12.';
const L2P55 =
    'For 2,000 years, people have attacked the Holy Scriptures. They have tried to alter and destroy them, yet they still stand, for God has preserved His Word from His enemies.';
const L2P56 =
    'Every youth should have their own Holy Scriptures and study to find its verses as much as they can.';
const L2P57 =
    'Do not let anyone steal your faith in the Holy Scriptures. This is the greatest protection for a youth. It removes every sin of the heart and life, is always trustworthy, always helps you, and brings salvation to all who follow it.';
