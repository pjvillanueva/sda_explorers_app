  'L20T1': 'If a Child Dies Without Being Baptized, Will They Be Lost?',
  'L20M2':
      'And He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature: He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned - Mark 16:15,16.',
  'L20P3':
      'This verse shows that baptism is very important: important enough that a person must understand what baptism means and what God expects from them. You cannot rely on what people say. You must hold on to the BIBLE ALONE as your guide.',
  'L20S4': 'SHOULD INFANTS BE BAPTIZED?',
  'L20Q5':
      '1. According to Matthew, what were Jesus\' last important words to His disciples?',
  'L20B6':
      'And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, BAPTIZING THEM in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; TEACHING THEM TO OBEY EVERYTHING I HAVE COMMANDED YOU, and surely, I am with you always, to the very end of the age. - Matthew 28:19-20.',
  'L20P7':
      'These were Jesus\' instructions to His disciples when He sent them out to bring His great plan of salvation to the lost.',
  'L20Q8': '2. What is required before baptism?',
  'L20B9':
      'And the eunuch said, Look, here is water. What prevents me from being baptized? And Philip said: IF YOU BELIEVE with all your heart, you may. And he answered and said: I BELIEVE that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And he commanded the chariot to stop; and THEY BOTH WENT DOWN INTO THE WATER, Philip and the eunuch, and HE BAPTIZED HIM. - Acts 8:36, 38.',
  'L20P10':
      'A baptized person must believe in Jesus Christ and His power to save.',
  'L20P11':
      'Before baptism, a person must repent of their sins and turn to a new life. (See Lesson 5.)',
  'L20P12':
      'Jesus clearly states in our first verse that before being baptized, one must be taught to obey everything He commanded them. People cannot explain Jesus\' teachings and commands to an infant, so baptizing babies has no purpose or meaning.',
  'L20P13':
      'If a child is ten or twelve years old, they are usually old enough to understand the Bible for themselves and make their own decision. If YOU have not been baptized, you should plan to do so soon. The fact that you were sprinkled as a baby means nothing in God\'s eyes. If you are old enough to decide for yourself, you must make your own decision about baptism, and only then will it have value for you.',
  'L20P14':
      'Jesus is not concerned with meaningless infant baptisms. Jesus rejoices in their decision when they are old enough to choose to come to Him and be baptized. Children should be taught to pray as soon as they learn to speak. This way, they will learn to love Jesus and His Word early. And when they reach ten or twelve years old, they will clearly understand the Bible to decide for themselves and be baptized.',
  'L20S15': 'IS BAPTISM NECESSARY FOR SALVATION?',
  'L20Q16': '3. Is baptism absolutely necessary for us to be saved?',
  'L20B17':
      'Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent Him, saying, I need to be baptized by You, and You come to me? But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it to be so now, for THUS IT IS FITTING FOR US TO FULFILL ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS. Then he allowed Him. - Matthew 3:13-15.',
  'L20P18':
      'Jesus says here that baptism is necessary to fulfill all righteousness. Baptism is an essential step of faith if you want to fully follow the Christian life. Jesus, though sinless, insisted on being baptized to fulfill all righteousness. What determines whether a person is ultimately saved or lost is whether they are willing or unwilling to follow Jesus\' teachings and example completely. You are old enough to decide for Christ. Do not neglect baptism.',
  'L20Q19':
      '4. How do we show that we truly "put on Christ"; that is, accept His life?',
  'L20B20':
      'For all of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. - Galatians 3:27.',
  'L20P21':
      'We are not baptized to show that we are better than others. Baptism is a sacred ceremony declaring to the world and to heaven that we have decided to live for Jesus and publicly unite with Him and His church. God\'s followers offered sheep and other sacrifices before Jesus died on the cross. These offerings could not save anyone, but the faith of the repentant sinner reached forward to the sacrifice of the "Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world," as John the Baptist called Jesus at His baptism. (See John 1:29.) If God\'s people neglected to offer such sacrifices, they were lost.',
  'L20P22':
      'Now, instead of offering sacrifices, we look back to Jesus\' death in faith. And now, Jesus asks us to be baptized instead of continuing to offer sheep. He requires only a simple ceremony: but the ceremony of baptism is truly important for salvation if one has had the opportunity to study God\'s Word.',
  'L20P23':
      'The thief on the cross was not baptized because his physical condition made it impossible. Some accepted Christ before death; they desired baptism but could not be baptized due to their physical situation. That is very different from rejecting baptism after seeing its importance in God\'s Word.',
  'L20P24':
      'Baptism alone does not save anyone, but if a person follows all other biblical teachings and deliberately refuses baptism, they are lost.',
  'L20S25': 'MEANING OF BAPTISM',
  'L20Q26': '5. What does baptism symbolize or represent?',
  'L20B27':
      'Do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus WERE BAPTIZED INTO HIS DEATH? WE WERE THEREFORE BURIED WITH HIM through baptism into death, so that just as Christ WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD through the glory of the Father, WE TOO MAY WALK IN NEWNESS OF LIFE. - Romans 6:3-5.',
  'L20P28':
      'Baptism shows that you accept Christ\'s death as payment for your sins. If you refuse to be buried with Jesus in baptism while He leads you, His death cannot redeem your sins. If you are buried in baptism, you do not remain in the water but rise again to a new life in Jesus... a Christian life.',
  'L20P29':
      'Baptism is a great memorial of Jesus\' death, burial, and resurrection. Some say they keep Sunday in honor of Jesus\' resurrection. But the Bible teaches that baptism is the true memorial of Jesus\' resurrection. Every biblical record of baptism shows that a person was immersed in water—symbolizing burial with Jesus.',
  'L20B30': 'One Lord, one faith, ONE BAPTISM. -Ephesians 4:5',
  'L20P31':
      'There is only one baptism in the Bible, a burial under water. Some were baptized when it had little meaning to them. They should be rebaptized. (Acts 19:4, 5). If a person is living in sin, violating the Sabbath, smoking, drinking, or robbing God through tithes, and so on, they will desire to be rebaptized.',
  'L20S32': 'DANGER OF DELAYING BAPTISM',
  'L20Q33':
      '6. After a person understands the biblical truths and the teachings of Jesus, how long should they wait to be baptized?',
  'L20P34': 'The Bible record about Paul states:',
  'L20B35':
      'AND NOW WHY DO YOU WAIT? RISE AND BE BAPTIZED and wash away your sins, calling on His name. -Acts 22:16.',
  'L20P36': 'And it says about the prison guard:',
  'L20B37':
      'And he TOOK THEM THE SAME HOUR OF THE NIGHT and washed their wounds, and IMMEDIATELY HE WAS BAPTIZED. -Acts 16:33.',
  'L20B38':
      'And it says about the prince who had been taught by Philip: Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached Jesus to him... And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch; and HE BAPTIZED HIM. -Acts 8:35, 38.',
  'L20P39':
      'Take note that if a person is ready for baptism, it should not be delayed for a long time. Satan’s most dangerous trap is to tempt people to postpone their decision. Do not hesitate. If you are ready to follow all that you have learned in the Bible and obey all of Jesus’ commands, you should be baptized as soon as possible.',
  'L20Q40': '7. How important is baptism?',
  'L20B41':
      'And baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you—not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. -1 Peter 3:21',
  'L20B42':
      'Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, UNLESS ONE IS BORN OF WATER and the Spirit, HE CANNOT ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD." -John 3:5.',
  'L20P43':
      'These words are serious. Peter says we are saved through baptism. In John 3:5, Jesus tells Nicodemus, the wealthy Jewish ruler, that unless a person is born again of water and the Holy Spirit enters their heart, they cannot be saved. Read your memory verse again and see how important baptism is for you and for anyone who wants to be saved.',
  'L20P44':
      'Let your mind go back over 2,100 years to the banks of the Jordan River. Standing there is a tall young man, water dripping from his body because he has just been baptized. Suddenly, heaven opens. Listen:',
  'L20B45':
      'When Jesus was baptized, He immediately came up from the water, and the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on Him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." -Matthew 3:16, 17.',
  'L20P46':
      'Jesus is pleading with outstretched arms for you. "Follow me." Will you follow Him?',
  'L20S47': 'PRAYER',
  'L20P48':
      'Dear Jesus, give me strength NOW to follow You completely. Do not let me delay my decision. Give me strength to surrender everything and be baptized. I ask this in Your Name. Amen.'
