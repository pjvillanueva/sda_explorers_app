  'L21T1': 'Is It Necessary to Join the Church to Be Saved?',
  'L21M2':
      'Here is the patience of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. - Revelation 14:12',
  'L21P3':
      'Many people wonder why they should join a church. Some ask, "Can’t I be saved without joining a church?" Others reason, "Aren’t all churches leading to the same place?" And some inquire, "According to the Bible, which is God’s true church today?" These are important questions, and we will consider them in our study.',
  'L21S4': 'WHY JOIN THE CHURCH?',
  'L21Q5': '1. How did Jesus show His close relationship with the church?',
  'L21B6':
      '... for which reason He is NOT ASHAMED TO CALL THEM BRETHREN, saying, I will declare Your name to My brethren... - Hebrews 2:11, 12.',
  'L21P7':
      'Some people hesitate to join the church because they see some insincere (hypocritical) members, but Jesus has such a close relationship with the church that He is not ashamed to call some members "brethren." Even though Judas, who betrayed the Savior, was a member of the church, Jesus was not ashamed to associate with that church. If so, why are we unwilling to join the church? The church of God may not be able to remove unfaithful members, but it should never allow the teaching of false doctrines.',
  'L21Q8': '2. What is the church compared to?',
  'L21B9': 'And He is the head of the BODY, THE CHURCH. - Colossians 1:18.',
  'L21P10':
      'The church is compared to the human body. Not all parts of the body are the same, but each part is essential, and all must work together in unity.',
  'L21Q11': '3. What is the door to the church?',
  'L21B12':
      'For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by ONE SPIRIT WE WERE ALL BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY. - 1 Corinthians 12:12, 13.',
  'L21P13':
      'It is now clear why baptism is important; it is the door to the church, which is the body of Jesus. Therefore, it is not right to neglect baptism—joining Jesus’ church, right?',
  'L21Q14': '4. What is essential along with baptism?',
  'L21B15':
      'Then those who gladly received His word were BAPTIZED; and that day about three thousand souls were added to them. AND THE LORD ADDED TO THEM daily those who were being saved. - Acts 2:41, 47.',
  'L21P16':
      'The Lord did not tell them to be baptized only but also to be added to the church. If church membership is that important, we should not neglect baptism and joining the church.',
  'L21Q17': '5. What did Jesus clearly say about those who refuse to unite with Him?',
  'L21B18':
      'HE WHO IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME; and HE WHO DOES NOT GATHER WITH ME SCATTERS ABROAD. - Matthew 12:30.',
  'L21P19':
      'A sergeant’s wife reasoned, "I see that baptism is important, but I just don’t want to join a church. I can be just as good a Christian on my own."',
  'L21P20':
      'The minister responded, "Your husband is in the army. Suppose a soldier says, ‘Oh, I believe it’s good to be a good soldier. Look, I have a uniform; boots, a rifle, and so on, but there’s just one thing: I don’t want to belong to the army.’ Surely, if a man is a good and faithful soldier, he will be expected to join the body—the army. In the same way, if one truly wants to be a good Christian, he will desire to unite with Christ’s spiritual body—the church. We can either be with Christ or against Him. A person who refuses to join the church, which is the body of Jesus, is against Him."',
  'L21S21': 'ARE ALL CHURCHES LEADING TO THE SAME PLACE?',
  'L21Q22': '6. Did Jesus intend to have many different denominations or churches?',
  'L21B23':
      'But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every CITY OR HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WILL NOT STAND. - Matthew 12:25.',
  'L21P24':
      'There are nearly six hundred so-called Christian denominations in the world today. Jesus is not pleased with all the division and confusion. How often young people say, "I don’t really know what to do. There are so many different denominations, and they all claim to be right. Does it really matter which church I join?"',
  'L21Q25': '7. What statement did Jesus make about the number of churches or "flocks" He recognizes?',
  'L21B26':
      'Most assuredly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, that same is a thief and a robber. Then Jesus said to them again, Most assuredly, I say to you, I AM THE DOOR OF THE SHEEP. And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they will hear My voice; and there will be ONE FLOCK AND ONE SHEPHERD. - John 10:1, 7, 16.',
  'L21P27':
      'Jesus here compares the church and its members to a great flock of sheep and a large sheepfold. Jesus is the door to that flock—the church. We join Him through baptism. If anyone tries to be saved in another way, Jesus says he is a thief and a robber.',
  'L21P28':
      'Note: Jesus clearly states that He has ONLY ONE FLOCK and that He is the door to that flock. In the days of Noah, when the Flood came, there was only ONE ARK, and people had to enter that ark to be saved. Jesus said, "And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man." - Luke 17:26. If we want to be saved at Jesus’ coming, we must be inside the flock or the church.',
  'L21Q29': '8. How many true faiths or churches does Jesus have in the world?',
  'L21B30': 'One Lord, ONE FAITH, one baptism. - Ephesians 4:5.',
  'L21P31':
    'There is only ONE church or faith recognized by God. If someone teaches that any type of baptism is acceptable, or that one church is just as good as another, they are not in harmony with the Bible.',
'L21Q32':
    '9. According to prophecy, what is God\'s final call to His people in the last days before the end?',
'L21B33':
    'After these things, I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illuminated with his glory. And he cried out with a loud voice, saying, "FALLEN, FALLEN IS BABYLON THE GREAT." And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, so that you do not partake in her sins and receive her plagues." - Revelation 18:1, 2, 4.',
'L21P34':
    'The meaning of Babylon is confusion. Indeed, there is great religious confusion among the six hundred different competing denominations. Jesus appeals to faithful Christians in these churches to come out and unite with His ONE church—ONE flock, ONE body. Isn\'t it natural for Jesus to call His followers together into one organization or church? Why wouldn\'t His people come out and separate themselves?',
'L21P35':
    'Shepherds in Palestine often let their sheep graze together, but when one of them calls, all his sheep follow him; they recognize his voice. The true sheep of Jesus today will come out and follow His flock.',
'L21P36':
    'If people see that their church does not follow all the teachings of the Bible, they should have the courage to leave and join Jesus’ chosen people, deciding to follow the Bible in every way, no matter the opposition.',
'L21S37': 'HOW CAN I IDENTIFY THE TRUE CHURCH?',
'L21Q38': '10. What does God call the saints?',
'L21B39':
    'Here is the perseverance of the saints: those WHO KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD AND THE FAITH OF JESUS. And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and upon the cloud sat one like the Son of Man. - Revelation 14:12, 14.',
'L21B40':
    'Blessed are those WHO WASH THEIR ROBES, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates. - Revelation 22:14.',
'L21P41':
    'Many churches claim to be the true church. But it is not human judgment or decision that makes a church righteous; it is what GOD says.',
'L21P42':
    'In these verses, God describes His church in the days before Jesus returns: "Here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus," the great message from God directing sincere truth-seekers to His true church. Follow that message.',
'L21P43':
    'A true child of God will earnestly seek the church that meets the great biblical tests of God\'s true church in the last days. The biblical test is faith in Jesus Christ as our Savior from sin and obedience to all His Ten Commandments.',
'L21P44':
    'There are good and holy people in all churches. Jesus sincerely loves them, but He is calling all His followers into one flock. In this flock, He gathers those who desire to keep His commandments and accept Jesus as their Savior. These great biblical truths you are studying in these lessons are currently being preached in over seven hundred languages worldwide. A great spiritual revival is happening across the globe. And it should, for Jesus is coming soon. His chosen people, His church, proclaim the message: "Prepare to meet your God, O Israel." Are you ready for Jesus\' return? Are you willing to unite with a people devoted to preaching to the world that "Jesus is coming again" and teaching obedience to His commandments?',
'L21Q45':
    '11. How will God\'s followers be treated in the last days?',
'L21B46':
    'And the dragon (Satan) was enraged with the woman and went to wage war against the rest of her offspring (the final church), THOSE WHO KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD AND HAVE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS. - Revelation 12:17.',
'L21P47':
    'Satan will persecute Jesus\' obedient followers and bring great suffering to the remnant church. The word "remnant" means the last of anything. The remnant church is the final church, and it keeps God\'s commandments. As you begin to follow all that Jesus teaches, you will face opposition; you may even be persecuted. But Jesus offers this comfort:',
'L21B48':
    'Blessed are those WHO ARE PERSECUTED for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. - Matthew 5:10.',
'L21P49':
    'Will you decide to follow Jesus all the way and obey His commandments? Will you enter His flock? Will you make that surrender today?',
'L21S50': 'NEXT LESSON',
'L21P51':
    'Our next lesson is one you will want to study, as it will answer these questions: How can we know that Jesus’ coming is near? Does anyone know the exact time of Jesus’ return? Falling stars, airplanes, earthquakes, nineteen sins—explore these in your next lesson.'
