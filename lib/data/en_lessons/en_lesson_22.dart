  'L22T1': 'Signs That Prove the Nearness of Jesus’ Coming',
  'L22M2':
      'Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. - Matthew 24:42.',
  'L22P3':
      'Many ask if anyone can determine the exact time of Jesus’ return. Many try to set a date, but there is no biblical basis for it. Jesus clearly states in Matthew 24:36, "But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the Son, but only the Father." He also says about the signs He has given that indicate the time of His return: "So also, when you see all these things, you know that He is near, at the doors." - Matthew 24:33.',
  'L22P4':
      'As we witness "all these things" happening, we feel the overwhelming reality that Jesus’ return is very near, "at the doors."',
  'L22S5': 'THE SCOFFERS',
  'L22Q6': '1. What does Peter say will be one of the signs in the last days?',
  'L22B7':
      'In the last days, scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, "WHERE IS THIS COMING HE PROMISED?" - 2 Peter 3:3-4.',
  'L22B8':
      'Never before have there been so many scoffers mocking the teaching of the imminent return of Jesus. Thousands around the world, including those who claim to be Christians, ridicule the belief that Jesus will return in the clouds of heaven soon. We must be careful lest we say in our hearts, if not with our lips, "My Lord is delaying His coming." - Matthew 24:48.',
  'L22P9':
      'Let us study these clear prophecies that reveal Jesus’ coming is "at the doors."',
  'L22S10': 'INVENTIONS AND RAPID TRAVEL',
  'L22Q11':
      '2. What major changes will occur in the last days before the second coming of Jesus?',
  'L22B12':
      'But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end: MANY SHALL RUN TO AND FRO, AND KNOWLEDGE SHALL INCREASE. - Daniel 12:4.',
  'L22P13':
      'Just a hundred years ago, the world moved at the same speed as in Abraham’s time. People still rode horses, camels, pushed carts, or, at best, traveled in horse-drawn vehicles. Then suddenly, a great transformation took place. Inventions came one after another, allowing people to "run to and fro" using bicycles, ships, trains, cars, tanks, submarines, airplanes, and most astonishingly—rockets. Imagine traveling at 28,800 kilometers per hour. That’s 400 kilometers per minute—truly running "to and fro" in the end times. What a dramatic change in these last days!',
  'L22P14':
      'The world became obsessed with speed. Think about the time Magellan took to circumnavigate the globe. Recently, some men flew around the world in less than an hour and a half. This is what Daniel saw in a vision—that in the end times, people would "run to and fro and knowledge shall increase."',
  'L22P15':
      'The great advancements in civilization have proven to be a powerful blessing in spreading the gospel to the ends of the earth.',
  'L22P16':
      'In this vision of the end times, Daniel was also told that "knowledge shall increase." Consider some of the remarkable discoveries of the past hundred years: the telephone, telegraph, electric lights, anesthesia for surgery, large printing presses—and among the most mysterious of all—radio, television, and cell phones. And remember, friends, these were discovered only in the last hundred years. Think about how God is using these great inventions ("knowledge shall increase") to bring the gospel to millions. Truly, the end is near, "at the doors."',
  'L22Q17':
      '3. What unusual signs will appear in the sun, moon, and stars before the end?',
  'L22B18':
      'Immediately after the distress of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT; THE STARS WILL FALL FROM THE SKY, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. - Matthew 24:29.',
  'L22P19':
      'This is one of Jesus’ most remarkable prophecies. The fulfillment of these signs should have shaken the entire world into realizing that Jesus’ coming is near, but in these last days, people hardly even mention these astounding events. This shows how Satan works to distract people from the signs given by Jesus, preventing them from waking up and preparing for the end.',
  'L22P20':
      'The great Dark Day, when the sun was darkened at midday, occurred on May 19, 1780. You can read about it in history books and encyclopedias. That night, the moon turned blood-red, and people thought the end had come.',
  'L22P21':
      'On the night of November 13, 1833, the entire sky was illuminated by falling stars. Thousands believed it was the end of the world. Science has yet to fully explain this astonishing event. These were the signs given by Jesus to declare that the earth had entered its last days.',
  'L22P22':
      'The darkening of the sun and moon and the falling of the stars are repeatedly mentioned in the Bible (Luke 21:25; Mark 13:24-25; Revelation 6:12-13; Joel 2:10). Since the falling of the stars in 1833, the world has witnessed a rapid succession of extraordinary signs of Jesus’ return. The end is very near, "at the doors."',
  'L22S23': 'WARS, FAMINES, PLAGUES, EARTHQUAKES',
  'L22Q24':
      '4. What terrifying events does Jesus say will increase in the last days?',
  'L22B25':
      'For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. THERE WILL BE FAMINES AND EARTHQUAKES in various places. - Matthew 24:7.',
  'L22P26':
      '1. Wars. We have already studied the increasing number of wars in the last days, causing millions of deaths. But in this lesson, we will focus on other signs.',
  'L22P27':
      '2. Famines. Wars cause famines. Crops are destroyed in battle; and when men are sent to war, there are not enough left to grow food. Additionally, Satan sends droughts and floods, causing millions to starve. Seven million people were reported to have died of hunger in one region of Russia a few years ago. How cruel Satan is! As we approach the end, God’s Holy Spirit is being withdrawn from the earth, allowing Satan to bring unimaginable terror and devastation.',
  'L22P28':
      '3. Plagues. A strange disease called "influenza" shook the world after World War I, sending 18,000,000 people to their graves—more than those who died in the war itself. Why, oh why, do people refuse to recognize these calamities as warning signs that the end is "at the doors"?',
  'L22P29':
      '4. Earthquakes. If Jesus had given no other sign of His return except the increase in earthquakes, it would have been enough...',
  'L22S30': 'NINETEEN SINS AS THE SIGN OF THE END OF THE WORLD',
  'L22Q31':
      '5. What are the nineteen sins that Paul mentioned as signs of the last days before the end?',
  'L22B32':
      'But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, DISOBEDIENT TO PARENTS, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, LOVERS OF PLEASURE RATHER THAN LOVERS OF GOD: Having a form of godliness but denying its power; from such people turn away. -2 Timothy 3:1-5.',
  'L22P33':
      'Carefully read those verses again. Paul listed some of the great signs in the lives of men and women, boys and girls, in the last days. We cannot study each of these nineteen sins one by one, but we will mention only two:',
  'L22P34':
      '1. Pride. One of the main reasons why people do not take a stand to be baptized and join the true church in these last days is because they are too afraid of what others might think of them. It is unfortunate that people are too proud to carry their cross for Jesus.',
  'L22P35':
      '2. "Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God." Perhaps you have seen churches filled with feasts, dancing, card games, raffles, shows, and more. They try to keep their youth from going out into the world. However, it is just as bad for a church to offer worldly entertainment as it is for young people to seek the world. One of the signs showing that Jesus is coming soon is the fact that the world, yes, and thousands of Christians—are obsessed with pleasure, "lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God." Yet, they still try to hold on to some form of religion. God will judge this.',
  'L22B36':
      'So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth. -Revelation 3:16.',
  'L22P37':
      'God has greater regard for an openly worldly sinner than for a hypocritical Christian who still clings to the world and its pleasures. (Revelation 3:15)',
  'L22S38': 'THE FINAL SIGN',
  'L22Q39':
      '6. What is the only thing standing between us and the coming of Jesus?',
  'L22B40':
      'And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and THEN THE END WILL COME. -Matthew 24:14.',
  'L22P41':
      'When the gospel message of Jesus’ coming has been preached to the world, He will return. These truths that you are studying are currently being preached in nearly seven hundred languages by those fulfilling the command of God’s last church. The greatest sign that Jesus’ return is near is the fact that thousands in many lands are standing up to obey God’s commandments and prepare for His coming. The world is being warned rapidly. And when this worldwide warning is fully proclaimed, Jesus will declare from heaven, "It is finished." Will you be ready then?',
  'L22P42':
      'A mother and her four children were excited because their father was coming home that day. He had been on a ship for a month and was now just a few hours away from returning home.',
  'L22P43':
      'There was a knock at the door. It was the minister. "Madam, I have terrible news for you. Just a few hours after leaving the port, your husband’s ship hit the rocks, and he drowned."',
  'L22P44':
      'In grief, the mother cried out, "Oh, he was so close to home, yet he was lost."',
  'L22P45':
      'Friend, we are almost home. The coming of Jesus is very near, "at the door." How terrible it would be if you neglect to follow Jesus all the way and be lost. Oh, surrender your life to Him, NOW.',
  'L22S46': 'PRAYER',
  'L22P47':
      'Dear Lord, help me to feel that the end is near. Help me to live righteously every day and be ready. Amen.'
