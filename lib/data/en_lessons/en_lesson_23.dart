  'L23T1': 'The Unforgivable Sin',
  'L23M2':
      'And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. - Ephesians 4:30.',
  'L23P3':
      'Many worry out of fear that they might have committed an unforgivable sin and fear that they may not find forgiveness for their sins. They think they are lost and that there is no point in striving to be Christians. Satan is pleased when they feel this way; he wants to drag them down into despair and destruction. In this lesson, we will study what this sin is and, most importantly, how we can avoid committing it.',
  'L23Q4': '1. What is the one sin that will never be forgiven?',
  'L23B5':
      'Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men; BUT BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE SPIRIT WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN. - Matthew 12:31.',
  'L23P6':
      'One might ask, "Does this mean that if someone swears using the name of the Holy Spirit, it is worse than using the name of God and that they can never be forgiven for it?"',
  'L23P7':
      'No, there is more to it than that. Many have uttered terrible words involving the Holy Spirit, yet they repented and found forgiveness.',
  'L23S8': 'WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT',
  'L23Q9':
      '2. What has been the work of the Holy Spirit since Jesus returned to heaven?',
  'L23B10':
      'When He comes, He will CONVICT the world OF SIN. However, when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, HE WILL GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH. - John 16:8, 13',
  'L23P11':
      'The Holy Spirit speaks to you and tells you what is right and wrong. He points out sin so you can avoid it. He also teaches you the truth so that you know what to follow. You should always bow your head in prayer before reading or studying the Bible and ask the Holy Spirit to help you understand and obey God’s Word. People drive away the Holy Spirit by refusing to obey God’s Word.',
  'L23Q12': '3. How does the Holy Spirit teach us?',
  'L23B13':
      'But the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, HE WILL TEACH YOU ALL THINGS AND BRING TO YOUR REMEMBRANCE ALL THAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU. - John 14:26',
  'L23B14':
      'Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk in it," when you turn to the right and when you turn to the left. - Isaiah 30:21',
  'L23P15':
      'The work of the Holy Spirit is to help us understand the Bible—the teachings of Jesus. Have you ever felt as if you were almost hearing a voice speaking to you when you were about to do something wrong? If you listen to the Holy Spirit’s voice, He will keep you from falling into sin. The Holy Spirit of God will always guide us according to the teachings of His Holy Word. If you refuse to listen and reject the Holy Spirit, you are without hope and bound to fall.',
  'L23Q16': '4. What does the Holy Spirit lead a person to do?',
  'L23P17':
      'Regarding the work of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of His followers, Jesus said:',
  'L23B18':
      'WHOEVER HAS MY COMMANDS and keeps them is the one who loves me. - John 14:21 SANCTIFY THEM BY THE TRUTH; YOUR WORD IS TRUTH. - John 17:17.',
  'L23P19':
      'If one follows the leading of the Holy Spirit, he will keep the Ten Commandments and obey all of God’s Word, the Bible, and he will ultimately be saved. If one continues to resist or reject the Holy Spirit’s promptings in his heart, he will truly be lost. By continually rejecting the Holy Spirit, a person commits the unforgivable sin. They will lose the desire to follow God, and there will be nothing more the Holy Spirit can do for them. Disobedience means death.',
  'L23S20': 'RESISTING THE SPIRIT',
  'L23Q21':
      '5. When justifying their sins, what false pretense do many people make?',
  'L23B22':
      'This is how we know that we know Him: if we keep His commands. WHOEVER SAYS, "I KNOW HIM," BUT DOES NOT KEEP HIS COMMANDS IS A LIAR, AND THE TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM. - 1 John 2:3-4.',
  'L23P23':
      'Isn’t that frightening? If a person claims to love Jesus but refuses to keep the Ten Commandments, they are called a liar. That is why it is important for a person to honor their father and mother according to the fifth commandment. That is also why it is crucial to carefully observe the seventh-day Sabbath. Many people in the world trample on God’s holy day every week and mock those who keep the Sabbath on Saturday. Many pretend to be good Christians but knowingly violate the fourth commandment every week.',
  'L23P24':
      'Unless these people repent after coming to the knowledge of Biblical truth, they have no hope.',
  'L23B25':
      'WHOEVER TURNS AWAY HIS EAR from hearing THE LAW, EVEN HIS PRAYER IS AN ABOMINATION. - Proverbs 28:9.',
  'L23P26':
      'It is a serious matter for someone to continue breaking God’s commandments after the Holy Spirit has brought them to their attention. If they persist in rejecting the Holy Spirit, they will be lost.',
  'L23Q27': '6. What warning does Paul give?',
  'L23B28': 'Do not quench the Spirit. - 1 Thessalonians 5:19.',
  'L23P29':
      'At the same time, read again the verse to memorize. There are many ways to grieve or quench the Spirit and make the Holy Spirit sorrowful. Many people drive away (grieve) the Holy Spirit from their hearts by drinking alcohol. Some gamble, others go to the movies or dance halls. Some listen to deceptive programs on the radio or television, while others read bad books or speak evil words. Some have bad friends; others steal. Some disobey their parents; some break the seventh-day Sabbath. Some refuse to give tithes; others cheat in their studies. Friend, any sin that you love and continue to practice will ultimately quench the Holy Spirit.',
  'L23S30': 'FINDING FORGIVENESS',
  'L23Q31':
      '7. If a person truly repents of any sin, can they be assured of forgiveness?',
  'L23B32':
      'IF WE CONFESS our sins, HE IS FAITHFUL AND JUST TO FORGIVE US OUR SINS AND TO CLEANSE US from all unrighteousness. -1 John 1:9',
  'L23P33':
      'Oh, the wonderful love of Jesus. The darkest sin can be forgiven if one only repents and confesses it. The unforgivable sin is the one that is not confessed. If a person does not confess their sin and repent, they are in a lost state. But if they repent, they can be assured of forgiveness. Have you repented of all your sins and confessed them? Will you strive to obey all that God requires as far as you know?',
  'L23Q34': '8. How can a person be saved?',
  'L23B35':
      'The one who comes to me I will by no means cast out. No one can come to me UNLESS THE FATHER who sent me DRAWS THEM TO ME. - John 6:37, 44.',
  'L23P36':
      'Anyone who comes to Jesus can be saved; but no one desires to come to Him unless the Holy Spirit works in their heart and draws them. If you refuse to listen to the pleadings of the Holy Spirit and do not strive to follow God’s commandments as found in the Bible, there is no other way to come to Jesus.',
  'L23S37': 'THE SPIRIT’S LAST CALL',
  'L23Q38':
      '9. What will ultimately happen to those who continuously resist the Holy Spirit?',
  'L23B39': '...THEIR CONSCIENCE IS SEARED as with a hot iron. -1 Timothy 4:2.',
  'L23P40':
      'Paul also speaks in Ephesians 4:19 about those who have lost all sensitivity. It is a terrifying thing to resist God’s pleadings in your heart until you can no longer hear His voice. A person who no longer feels convicted of their sins has a “seared conscience.”',
  'L23P41':
      'The Holy Spirit warns you about certain sins, saying: "That is wrong; you must not continue doing it if you hope to be saved." Or He may tell you: "You must follow all the commandments and be baptized if you wish to be saved." The longer you wait, the greater the danger of committing the unpardonable sin—ignoring the Holy Spirit’s promptings. Over time, you may no longer feel convicted of wrongdoing. A person who feels guilty for sin but continues in it is in grave danger.',
  'L23Q42': '10. Is there any hope for a person who continues to disobey?',
  'L23B43':
      'SO WHOEVER KNOWS the right thing to do and FAILS TO DO IT, FOR THEM IT IS SIN. - James 4:17.',
  'L23B44':
      'FOR IF WE DELIBERATELY CONTINUE SINNING after receiving knowledge of the truth, THERE NO LONGER REMAINS A SACRIFICE FOR SINS. - Hebrews 10:26.',
  'L23P45': 'Oh, friend, do not reject the truth of God’s Word.',
  'L23P46':
      'Mr. Moody tells the moving story of a man who was being swept down a river near Pittsburgh. His boat had lost control and was rapidly heading toward a deadly waterfall. Realizing the danger, he cried out for help. As he passed under a bridge, a rope was thrown to him, but he missed it. At the second bridge, another rope was thrown, but again, he could not grasp it. He had only one last chance as he approached the third and final bridge. When the lifeline was thrown, he jumped and barely caught it—but he was saved.',
  'L23P47':
      'Jesus is throwing you a lifeline, but there comes a time when it is the last opportunity. Do not disregard His urgent invitation. If you surrender your heart to Him, He will save you and cleanse you from all your sins.',
  'L23P48':
      'Do not delay your surrender. If you have not yet done so, make your decision now and join the church that obeys His commandments in these last days, before the end comes, while the Holy Spirit is still speaking to you.',
  'L23S49': 'PRAYER',
  'L23P50':
      'Dear Jesus, help me listen to Your Spirit’s voice and obey it. Do not cast me away, but lead me to do what is right and help me walk fully in Your Word. Amen.',
  'L23S51': 'NEXT LESSON',
  'L23P52':
      'Our next and final lesson is entitled "Living for Jesus." It is very different from the previous lessons. You will appreciate the practical help it gives you in your daily walk with Jesus. Just one more lesson, and you will complete the course.'
