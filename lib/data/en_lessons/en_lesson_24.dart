      'Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. Revelation 2:10',
  'L24P3': 'DEAR FRIEND,',
  'L24P4':
      'This is the last lesson we will study together in this course, so we are making it a personal letter to you—a heart-to-heart talk about living for Jesus. You will no longer have a questionnaire to answer, but we ask you to carefully read every part of this final lesson.',
  'L24P5':
      'We feel a bit of sadness as we reach the final lesson of this course. It has been our pleasure to see you continue, and we hope that many of you will take a more advanced course for adults.',
  'L24P6':
      'We also want to ask you, right now, to do everything you can to encourage others to take this course. Write to your friends, visit them, and invite them to enroll immediately. Perhaps someone may find the way to God because of your invitation. Pray that the Lord will help you bring at least one soul to Him.',
  'L24P7':
      'There are so many things we want to write to you before you receive your certificate of honor. Here are some important suggestions to help you in your effort to live a life for Jesus from now on.',
  'L24P8':
      '1. You must spend time in prayer every day. Every morning, as soon as you wake up, kneel by your bed and ask the Lord to keep you faithful to Him throughout the day.',
  'L24P9': 'Prayer is simply talking to Jesus—and He wants you to talk to Him.',
  'L24P10':
      'Every night, before you sleep, quietly kneel by your bed and offer a prayer to Jesus, who holds your life in His hands. How can some people lie down without asking Jesus to protect and guard them? Every morning, kneel by your bed and ask Jesus to watch over you that day. Do not face the day without first coming to the Lord in prayer. The first moments of each day should be spent in prayer.',
  'L24P11':
      'Always come to the Lord in prayer when seeking help during sickness. Perhaps one of your loved ones has not yet given their heart to God. Do not forget to pray for them. Earnest prayer can soften even the hardest hearts. Friends, PRAYER is your greatest power. When you pray, you are asking all of heaven for help. God will not reject you, so do not forget to pray.',
  'L24P12':
      'If you stumble and fall into sin, do not say, "Oh, there is no use trying anymore; I am too weak." Satan wants you to give up in discouragement. Jude prayed:',
  'L24B13':
      'Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy. - Jude 24.',
  'L24P14': 'John, the beloved disciple, reminds you:',
  'L24B15':
      'My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. AND IF ANYONE SINS, WE HAVE AN ADVOCATE with the Father, JESUS CHRIST the RIGHTEOUS. - 1 John 2:1',
  'L24P16':
      'So never forget to pray. If we repent and come to Jesus (our Advocate) in prayer, asking Him to forgive our sins, He will hear us and cover our sins with His blood. So if you fall into sin or make a mistake, no matter how discouraged you feel, do not forget to pray.',
  'L24P17':
      'Your prayer may not seem to go beyond the ceiling. It may seem like no one hears and that Jesus has forgotten you—but He hasn’t. So NEVER FORGET TO PRAY.',
  'L24P18':
      '2. You must spend time every day reading the Bible. When you read the Bible, God is speaking to you. When you pray, you are speaking to God. Do not let your conversation be one-sided. Plan to read the Bible completely. If you read two chapters from the Old Testament and one from the New Testament daily, you will finish the Bible in about a year. The Bible will become more exciting to you as you grow closer to it. The Bible is God’s letter to you; it tells you what He expects of you. On the day of judgment, the Bible will be God’s measure for every life. You must read every page of it. Before opening the Bible to read, always offer a silent prayer to God, asking Him to send His Holy Spirit to help you understand and follow His Word. Through these lessons, you have learned many new truths found in God’s Word. Continue to read and study your Bible. The Holy Spirit will be your religious guide to fully understand it.',
  'L24P19':
      'As you talk with others about religious topics, you will encounter many different beliefs in the world. Before accepting any doctrine, always insist on seeing where it is taught in the Bible. The Bible, and the Bible alone, should be your guide. Satan hates it when you read your Bible. To be a strong Christian, be sure to read your Bible every day.',
  'L24P20':
      'According to prophecy, there will come a time when laws will be passed in many countries forbidding ministers from preaching the truths you have been studying from God’s Word. When that time comes, children will become God’s messengers. Study your Bible carefully now so that in those days, you can tell others the great truths of the Bible.',
  'L24P21':
      '3. Always be PATIENT. That is one of the hardest things to do. It is not enough to know what the Bible teaches. You must live these truths before others in your daily life. As someone once said, "Your life is the only Bible some people will ever read."',
  'L24P22':
      'You may be mocked and laughed at, but as you live now while waiting for Jesus’ return, be sure to live a kind, patient Christian life.',
  'L24P23':
      'Remember what the Bible says about God’s people in the last church.',
  'L24B24':
      'Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. - Revelation 14:12.',
  'L24P25':
      'It is not enough to keep the Ten Commandments and believe in Jesus; you must have patience in your daily life.',
  'L24P26':
      '4. Attend Sabbath School and church meetings regularly. If there is a Seventh-day Adventist church near you, you should become a member immediately and attend regularly. If there is none, you may be baptized in a Sabbath-keeping church by a visiting minister. You can also hold Sabbath School in your home with neighbors. Special Sabbath School lesson topics are prepared just for you, and we will be happy to help you get them. If your parents keep the Sabbath and there is no nearby Sabbath-keeping church you can attend, you can have a meaningful Sabbath School at home. You can invite your friends and neighbors to your home Sabbath School and help them learn...',
  'L24P27': 'In the new earth, we will attend Sabbath School together.',
  'L24B28':
      'And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another, and FROM ONE SABBATH TO ANOTHER, ALL FLESH SHALL COME TO WORSHIP BEFORE ME, says the Lord. - Isaiah 66:23.',
  'L24P29':
      'While we are here on earth, we must make it a habit to regularly attend our worship every Sabbath.',
  'L24P30':
      '5. Tell others about your new faith in Jesus. Thousands of people are yearning for a simple understanding of what the Bible teaches. You must be God’s witnesses so that you can share these new truths you have learned with others. In this way, many more will learn these things before it is truly too late.',
  'L24P31':
      'Jesus will soon come. You must do everything you can to tell others and help them be ready. Many who refuse to listen to a preacher will listen to you. By simply sharing what the Bible teaches and living a careful life for Jesus, many will decide to follow Him fully.',
  'L24P32':
      '6. THE GREAT GATHERING DAY is in the future. What a wonderful joy it will be to meet all of you who have accepted Jesus through these lessons. We will not say goodbye, because we want to see you "there." We only want to make sure you find your way to Jesus’ final church. We want to make sure you are ready every day for His coming. We want you, along with the other graduates of the Voice of Prophecy, to see Jesus face to face when He returns. We want you all to enjoy your eternal home in heaven. YOU WILL BE THERE, WON’T YOU?',
  'L24P33': 'Your eternal friend, THE VOICE OF PROPHECY',
  'L24P34':
      'We want you to keep in touch with us. Please let us know whenever we can assist you. And don’t forget to pray for us.',
  'L24B35': 'I have finished the race. - 2 Timothy 4:7.',
  'L24S36': 'PRAYER',
  'L24P37':
      'Dear Lord, as I reach the end of my course, give me strength to continue following Your will and help me remain faithful until the end. Help me now to surrender everything to You, and in the end, may I find my place in heaven. I ask this in Jesus’ name. Amen.'
