  'L4P3':
      'We will study how sin entered the world, how Satan made this earth his headquarters, and what the remedy for sin is.

Our memory verse, which is perhaps the most beloved verse in the Bible, reveals that God has a personal interest and concern for humanity’s salvation. He gave His only begotten Son to save the world. No greater sacrifice could be made.',

  'L4P11':

There was only one tree—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil—that they were to completely avoid, for its consequence was death. They were forbidden to eat from it. Disobedience would mean rejecting God—the source of life. Therefore, death would naturally follow.',
  'L4S18': 'MAN’S FIRST SIN',
  'L4Q19':
      '6. Read the sorrowful story of how the serpent deceived Eve and led both her and Adam to disobey God for the first time.',

For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. - Genesis 3:1-6.',
  'L4P21':
      'If you continue reading the following verses, you will learn that when God came down to talk with Adam and Eve, they hid among the trees in shame.

  'L4P24':
      'The serpent that hid in the forbidden tree was none other than Satan, who was cast out from heaven. What a terrible deception! If only Adam and Eve had realized that it was Satan deceiving them. They disobeyed their Creator; they rejected God and sided with the enemy—Satan. They deserved death.',
  'L4P25':

  'L4P29':
      'This verse may seem difficult to understand, but the words within it help us see whom God is addressing.

Jesus had a mother on earth (Mary) and a Father in heaven (God). No wonder He could bring heaven and earth together.",
  "L4Q34":
      "10. When Jesus was baptized, what clear evidence was given to the world that He is the Son of God?",
  "L4B35":
      "And when Jesus was baptized, He immediately came up from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on Him, and behold, A VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAID, 'THIS IS MY BELOVED SON, in whom I am well pleased.' - Matthew 3:16, 17.",
  "L4P36":
      "Jesus was baptized before He began preaching, teaching, and healing the sick. At His baptism, the Father spoke these wonderful words, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.'

AND THEY SPAT ON HIM and took the reed and STRUCK HIM on the head... and they led Him out TO BE CRUCIFIED. And above His head, they placed the inscription written about Him: 'THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.' - Matthew 26:59, 27:1, 29, 31, 37.",
  "L4P40":
      "They crucified Him. This is the saddest scene in the history of the world. The religious leaders of that time hated Jesus because He exposed the sin in their lives. They were jealous because the people wanted to listen to Jesus. So they crucified Him. They did not realize that through His death on the cross, Jesus would save all who would come to Him for forgiveness and salvation. Jesus willingly died in place of mankind. All who believe in Him and follow Him will be saved.",
  "L4Q41": "12. What will Jesus do with our sins if we confess them?",

      "Jesus, who is now with His Father in heaven, is preparing to return to gather all His faithful ones. HE WILL TAKE THEM TO BE WITH HIM. Imagine—no sickness, no death—only eternal life in heaven with Jesus. Jesus is waiting for you to give your heart to Him today. He longs to forgive you and save you from sin, and if you come to Him, He will take you at last to be with Him in His heavenly home.",
