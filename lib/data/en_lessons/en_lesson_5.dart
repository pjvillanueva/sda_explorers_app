  'L5T1': 'How to Be Saved?',
  'L5M2':
      'Unless you turn and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. — Matthew 18:3',
  'L5P3':
      'Thousands of people long to know how they can be sure of their salvation. Jesus explained in our memory verse that the way to heaven is simple and can be understood even by a small child.',
  'L5Q4':
      '1. What is the great need for us to have the desire to turn away from sin?',
  'L5B5':
      'Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? - Romans 7:24',
  'L5P6':
      'If one seeks the way to Jesus and salvation, he must first feel the evil of sin, recognize his sinful condition, and acknowledge his need for help. Regarding his struggle with sin, Paul referred to himself as "wretched."',
  'L5P7':
      'If you visit the museum in Athens, Greece, you will see a peculiar sight in one of the last rooms. Two bodies are chained together by a heavy iron chain. The bodies and the chain have turned into stone. You may ask, "What does that have to do with sin?"',
  'L5P8':
      'In the past, courts sometimes sentenced criminals to be chained to a dead body. Imagine how horrifying it would be to endure a slow and dreadful death while tied to a corpse. Those bodies that turned to stone in the Athens museum were once a living person chained to a dead body. When the living person died, both bodies were buried together. Sin works the same way—if you remain bound to a sinful life, it will destroy your desire to do what is right and will ultimately lead to destruction.',
  'L5P9':

  'L5P13':
      'Here is a picture of a sinful jailer who suddenly felt his deep need for a Savior. He was afraid he might be lost, and in anguish, he cried out, "What must I do to be saved?" Jesus, our loving and merciful Savior, will never ignore such a call.',
  'L5S14': 'REPENTANCE',
  'L5Q15': '3. What is the next step toward Jesus—toward salvation?',
  'L5B16':
      'Repent, therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out. - Acts 3:19',
  'L5P17':
      'Paul told the crowd, whose hearts were eager for salvation, to "repent."',
  'L5P18':
      'You may ask, "What does it mean to repent?" Repentance simply means turning away from a sinful life. Sin leads to death. Remember, "the wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23). If you choose to accept Jesus as your Savior, He will change your heart; you must turn in a new direction toward eternal life. Repentance is that simple—turn away from the old path of sin and follow Jesus.',

  'L5B26': 'Confess your sins to one another. - James 5:16',
  'L5P27':
      'If someone has stolen from another, lied about someone, or hurt others in any way, he should go to that person, confess his wrongdoing, and make amends as much as possible. Sins committed against others should be confessed to both God and the person affected; some sins should be confessed to God alone.',

  'L5B29': 'For we walk by faith, not by sight. - 2 Corinthians 5:7',
