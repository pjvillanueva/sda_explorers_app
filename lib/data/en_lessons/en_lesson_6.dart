  'L6T1': 'From Eden to Eden',
  'L6M2':
      'Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. — Revelation 21:1',
  'L6S3': 'CREATION AND THE ENTRANCE OF SIN.',
  'L6P4':
      'We have studied how God created this world. Adam and Eve were placed in the Beautiful Garden of Eden and were given dominion over the earth. According to the Bible, the creation of this earth and Adam and Eve happened 6,000 years ago. Because Adam and Eve gave in to Satan’s temptation, they were expelled from Eden. After that, they became subject to suffering, sorrow, and hardship.',
  'L6P5':
      'Adam and Eve had two sons—Cain and Abel. (See Genesis 4:12). Abel was faithful to God, but Cain chose to follow Satan. One day, Cain became angry and killed Abel, who was offering a sacrifice as an act of worship. The lamb he offered symbolized Jesus. Abel showed his faith by offering the lamb, believing that Jesus would come one day to die for his sins and redeem him from death.',
  'L6P6':
      'Eventually, Adam and Eve had more children besides Cain and Abel. (See Genesis 5:4). These children grew up, had many descendants, and the population increased as God had said.',
  'L6S7': 'THE EARLY PATRIARCHS.',
  'L6P8':
      'As you read Genesis 5, you will be amazed to learn how long Adam’s children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren lived. The earth was still young; people had not yet fully experienced the effects of long years of sin. Although they were much stronger physically in those days, many lived over nine hundred years. Methuselah lived the longest—969 years. Some of these men obeyed God. The head of each family was called a "patriarch" or "father." These holy men taught their children the story of creation and the things God had revealed to their ancestors. In those early days, God’s message was passed down from one generation to the next through these patriarchs or tribal leaders.',
  'L6S9': 'THE FLOOD.',
  'L6P10':
      'As time passed, people became more wicked and refused to listen to God’s messages delivered through His prophets and patriarchs. God gave this message to Noah, one of the patriarchs, fourteen hundred years after creation.',
  'L6B11':
      '"My Spirit shall not strive with man forever... yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years... So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth... And behold, I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die." — Genesis 6:3, 12, 17',
  'L6P12':
      'God told Noah that He would allow the world to continue for 120 more years and then destroy it with a flood.',
  'L6P13':
      'He instructed Noah to build an ark—a large boat. Anyone who repented of their sins could enter the ark before the flood came. They would only be saved by entering the ark.',
  'L6P14':
      'Noah preached for 120 years, but only eight people—Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives—accepted the final call of mercy and entered the ark. Some of each kind of animal were also saved so that animals would repopulate the earth after the flood.',
  'L6P15':
      'It is terrifying to think that almost everyone refused to obey God and enter the ark. Thousands drowned when the flood came because they did not believe and did not heed the warnings. Every living thing on earth was destroyed. Animals, fish, trees, and people were buried deep in the earth. Mountains rose due to terrifying earthquakes. The flood lasted for a year. When the waters receded, Noah, his family, and the animals came out of the ark.',
  'L6P16':
      'Noah’s sons had children, and within a few years, the earth was populated again. Some of them said, "Let us build a great tower so that if another flood comes, we will not drown." But they disobeyed God’s word; they had no reason to fear another flood. They began constructing the Tower of Babel. To stop their rebellious plan, God made them speak different languages. Unable to understand one another, they abandoned the tower and spread out to live in different parts of the earth. To this day, we find different languages throughout the world.',
  'L6S17': 'THE CALL OF ABRAHAM.',
  'L6P18':
      'After many years, people forgot about the flood—they forgot God’s warnings about sin. Yet, one man remained faithful to God—Abraham, who lived in Ur of the Chaldeans (Babylonia).',
  'L6B19':
      'And he believed in the Lord; and He accounted it to him for righteousness. — Genesis 15:6',
  'L6B20':
      'Now the Lord had said to Abram (Abraham), "Get out of your country, from your family and from your father’s house, to a land that I will show you." — Genesis 12:1',
  'L6P21':
      'The Lord asked Abraham to leave most of his relatives, who worshiped idols and disregarded God, and to go to another land—Palestine. This was about four hundred years after the flood. God promised to bless Abraham’s descendants and make them a great nation, even though he had no children at that time. When Abraham and Sarah were very old, the Lord remembered His promise and gave them a son—Isaac.',
  'L6P22':
      'Like his father, Isaac followed God. He had two sons—Esau and Jacob. The Lord favored Jacob and blessed him (later called Israel) because he obeyed God. He had twelve sons, and the Hebrew nation, often called the Jewish people, descended from them.',
  'L6P23':
      'Due to a famine in Palestine, Jacob’s family moved to Egypt, where they multiplied. The Egyptians enslaved them because they feared that Israel (Jacob’s descendants) might become too powerful.',
  'L6S24': 'FROM SLAVERY TO THE ISRAELITE KINGDOM.',
  'L6P25':
      'God did not forget His promises to Abraham. Four hundred years later, God called Moses, an Israelite shepherd in Midian, to lead the Israelites out of Egypt to Palestine (Canaan). Moses, with his brother Aaron, approached Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and demanded Israel’s freedom. Pharaoh mocked the idea and only let them go after Egypt was struck with plagues.',
  'L6P26':
      'As they fled Egypt, the Lord opened a path for the Israelites through the Red Sea. Moses led the people to Mount Sinai in Arabia. There, the Lord gave them the Ten Commandments, written by His own hand on stone tablets. These commandments had been taught before, but now they were written in stone by God’s own hand, ensuring that no one could change them.',
  'L6P27':
      'God also gave Moses all the laws that would govern Israel. He told Moses how they should offer sacrifices that pointed to the future sacrifice of Jesus...',
  'L6P28':
      'Moses led God’s people, Israel, through the wilderness toward Canaan. However, they were afraid to enter the land as God had promised because of the threats from unbelieving nations there. They did not trust God, so they were forced to wander in the wilderness for forty years.',
  'L6P29':
      'At the end of this period, they obeyed God, entered Canaan, conquered it, and settled there. The Lord sent holy men, judges, to lead and advise His people. After many years, they requested a king, and Saul was chosen. Because of his disobedience, David was chosen next by the Lord. He became a great king and established the kingdom of Israel.',
  'L6S30': 'DISOBEDIENCE AND CAPTIVITY AGAIN.',
  'L6P31':
      'The kingdom was divided into two parts during the days of Rehoboam, David’s grandson: (a) the kingdom of Judah (ruled by David’s lineage) and (b) the kingdom of Israel. For many centuries, different kings ruled over God’s people.',
  'L6P32':
      'Solomon, David’s son, was instructed by the Lord to build a temple in Jerusalem, the capital of the kingdom. This temple became the center of all their worship.',
  'L6P33':
      'If Israel had remained faithful to God and followed His commandments, they would have prospered and been foremost for God. Instead of honoring God as supreme, Israel drifted further into sin. God sent prophets such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, and others to warn Israel of their sins and the punishment that would follow if they did not repent. But they refused to follow God, so He allowed surrounding nations to invade and defeat them.',
  'L6P34':
      'God’s chosen people were taken into captivity. Though they were later allowed to rebuild Jerusalem, they never regained the glory of the former kingdom. This captivity happened six hundred years before Christ. For many centuries, God’s people found little relief, whether in Palestine or in foreign lands where many had been taken as captives.',
  'L6P35':
      'Daniel, whose prophecies we will study, was among those taken captive in Babylon, yet he remained faithful to God. Later, Ezra, Nehemiah, and others helped to restore God’s people in Jerusalem and across Palestine.',
  'L6S36': 'THE PROMISED SAVIOR.',
  'L6P37': 'After many centuries, a child was born in Bethlehem. Read:',
  'L6B38':
      'And there were shepherds in that same land, staying in the fields and keeping watch over their flocks by night. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood beside them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid. But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger." And suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to those on whom His favor rests." -Luke 2:8-14',
  'L6P39':
      'This is the sweetest story of all in the Bible. At last, the Savior arrived. Jesus came, and the angel declared about Him, "You shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins." Jesus began His ministry after His baptism at the age of thirty.',
  'L6P40':
      'Jesus preached, taught, and healed the sick for three and a half years, but the Jewish leaders had strayed so far from God that they refused to accept Jesus. Though they offered lambs and sacrifices, they failed to recognize that these pointed to Jesus and His sacrifice.',
  'L6P41':
      'Jesus chose twelve apostles to lead the Christian church. He taught them how to work and pray. When Jesus established the first church, He told Peter:',
  'L6B42':
      '"Upon this rock (Christ) I will build my CHURCH, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." -Matthew 16:18',
  'L6P43':
      '(For information about the authority given to the Christian Church, see Matthew 18:17,18.)',
  'L6P44':
      'At the end of Jesus’ ministry, one of His disciples betrayed Him. Jesus was falsely accused, unjustly tried, and on a Friday afternoon, He was crucified. He rested in the tomb on the Sabbath. On Sunday morning, an angel came down from heaven and called Jesus from the dead. He remained with His disciples for forty days, and one day, as He was walking out of Jerusalem toward the Mount of Olives, He told them:',
  'L6B45':
      '"You will receive power... and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." (While they were on the Mount of Olives, suddenly) He was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid Him from their sight. As they were gazing into heaven while He was ascending, suddenly two men in white robes stood beside them and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in the same way you have seen Him go into heaven." -Acts 1:8-11',
  'L6P46':
      'Jesus was taken to heaven, where, as our Great High Priest, He now intercedes for us. It has been over 2,000 years since Jesus left this earth.',
  'L6S47': 'THE JEWISH NATION REJECTED, THE GENTILES ACCEPTED.',
  'L6P48':
      'After three and a half years, the Jews stoned Stephen to death. The Jewish nation was no longer recognized as God’s chosen people. They sealed their judgment by stoning Stephen, one of the leaders of the early Christian church. However, individual Jews could still be saved.',
  'L6P49':
      'Paul, a prominent Jew who took part in stoning Stephen, soon after became a great missionary to the Gentiles. Regarding the rejection of Jesus by the Jewish leaders, Paul later said:',
  'L6B50':
      '"It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you; but since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the GENTILES." -Acts 13:46',
  'L6P51':
      'All non-Jews were considered Gentiles. Now, both Jews and Gentiles can find salvation by accepting Jesus Christ as their Savior. His blood covers the sins of all who come to Him in faith.',
  'L6S52': 'THE FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH GREW RAPIDLY AND FLOURISHED.',
  'L6B53':
      '"And that day, about three thousand souls were added to them... And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved." -Acts 2:41,47',
  'L6P54':
      'From Jerusalem and Judea, the gospel spread to different parts of the world, and the Christian church grew in strength. Thousands of early Christians were killed for their faith by the Roman government, which ruled most of the known world at that time. All but one of Jesus’ disciples—John, the beloved—were martyred for their faith. Yet, despite persecution, the church...',

  'L6S55': 'THE DARK AGES.',
  'L6P56':
      'About three hundred years after the establishment of the Christian Church, high-ranking government officials began to join the church and rise to prominence. The established church became proud and worldly. By the sixth century, the church was firmly established, and its leaders positioned themselves as spiritual authorities, corrupting the simple gospel of Jesus. Many false doctrines and teachings were introduced into the church by deceptive religious leaders. For twelve hundred years, there was great spiritual darkness. This period was called the "Dark Ages." During this time, strict persecution arose to prevent people from learning the truth and condemning the church for its false teachings. However, even in those long, dark years, God had many faithful followers who were severely oppressed and hunted by the corrupt members of the church. Thousands, even millions, of these faithful Christians were killed for their faith. They were called "Martyrs."',
  'L6S57': 'THE REFORMATION.',
  'L6P58':
      'Nearly four hundred years ago, some educated and godly men began to pray and study the Scriptures in the Bible. They discovered how far the church had strayed from the original teachings of Jesus. These men started preaching that Christ’s followers should change and return to the original teachings of the Bible. This led to a great religious awakening—a call for all to reform and return to the Bible. This powerful revival was called the "Reformation." We should be thankful to God that we now live in a time when we are allowed to read and study the Bible and learn the truth.',
  'L6S59': 'EDEN RESTORED.',
  'L6P60':
      'For the past hundreds of years and beyond, special emphasis has been given to preaching about the coming kingdom of Jesus. Many of our future lessons will focus on this topic. Next week, we will study HEAVEN—Eden restored.',
  'L6N61': '',
// 'L6S61': 'NEXT LESSON',
// 'L6P62':
// 'Lesson 7 is an exciting study about heaven—the restored Eden. Will there be animals in heaven? Will there be children there? Will people eat or work in heaven? Will we recognize each other in heaven?'
