  'L8T1': 'What and Where is Hell?',
  'L8M2':
      'Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to each one according to his work. - Revelation 22:12.',
  'L8P3':
      'In our previous lesson, we studied the eternal home of the righteous. Those who accept Jesus as their Savior and follow His commandments will live with Him forever. Jesus has given every person the right to choose: those who obey will be saved, but those who continue in sin will be lost.',
  'L8P4':
      'Millions ignore the teachings of the Bible; they do not listen to Jesus and refuse to follow His commandments. Because of their sins, Jesus cannot take them to heaven. What will happen to them? To find the answer, we must not rely on human opinions. Always make it a rule never to insist on what you think; the Bible is clear on every important question. Only God can provide the true answer.',
  'L8S5': 'HOW MANY ARE IN HELL NOW?',
  'L8Q6': '1. In what direction are most people traveling?',
  'L8B7':
      'Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to DESTRUCTION, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life, and only a few find it. - Matthew 7:13, 14.',
  'L8P8':
      'These are sorrowful words from Jesus. There are more wicked people in the world than righteous ones. All who refuse to follow the path of righteousness will be lost. Those who neglect to prepare for heaven cannot be saved.',
  'L8P9':
      'Many religions teach that when a wicked person dies, they immediately go to a place called "hell," where they suffer in fire forever. For centuries, this has been taught by many non-Biblical religions. Hundreds of years ago, this false teaching entered the Christian Church. But the question is, "What does the Bible teach?"',
  'L8Q10': '2. Does punishment by fire begin at death or at a future time?',
  'L8B11':
      'But the present heavens and the earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly. - 2 Peter 3:7.',
  'L8P12':
      'Peter clarifies that the cleansing of the world from sin by fire is still in the future. Peter also taught in Acts 24:25, where he warned a wicked king about the "judgment to come." The wicked will not be destroyed by fire until after they have been judged.',
  'L8Q13': '3. When did Jesus say sinners would be punished?',
  'L8B14':
      'For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and THEN HE WILL REWARD EACH PERSON according to what they have done. - Matthew 16:27.',
  'L8P15':
      'This verse, like our memory text, states that no one will receive their reward until Jesus comes with His angels. Therefore, the wicked are not in hell now.',
  'L8B16':
      'The one who rejects Me and does not receive My words has a judge; THE WORD THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WILL JUDGE HIM ON THE LAST DAY. - John 12:48.',
  'L8P17':
      'Again, Jesus clarifies that the wicked will be punished on the "last day," at the end of the world.',
  'L8Q18': '4. When will fire destroy all sinners?',
  'L8B19':
      'The field is the world, and the enemy who sows them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the END OF THE WORLD. - Matthew 13:38-40.',
  'L8P20':
      'At present, the wicked are not yet burned in a place called hell. Jesus says the wicked will be destroyed by fire at the end of the world.',
  'L8Q21': '5. What great event does Jesus say is still in the future?',
  'L8B22':
      'The hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear His voice and will come out: those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment. - John 5:28, 29.',
  'L8P23':
      'Why would the wicked need to be called from their graves on the day of resurrection if they are already in hell? Why would they face judgment if they have already been suffering in hell for hundreds of years? That would not make sense.',
  'L8P24':
      'Jesus taught that the wicked are ASLEEP IN THEIR GRAVES until the day of resurrection, when they will come out to receive their punishment. As of now, they are not yet suffering in hell.',
  'L8S25': 'WHERE IS HELL?',
  'L8Q26': '6. How does the Bible describe the final punishment of the wicked?',
  'L8B27':
      'The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended... And they went up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints, the beloved city. But fire came down from heaven and DEVOURED THEM. And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur... And death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire. - Revelation 20:5, 9, 14, 15.',
  'L8P28':
      'The wicked are raised in the second resurrection and will receive their punishment ON THIS EARTH. There is no terrifying chamber of torment called "hell." To cleanse the world of sin, sinners must be destroyed by fire.',
  'L8S29': 'THE COMPLETE END OF SIN',
  'L8Q30': '7. What will happen to the wicked when they burn?',
  'L8B31':
      'For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace: and all the proud, and all who do wickedly will be like stubble; and the day that is coming SHALL BURN THEM UP, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them NEITHER ROOT NOR BRANCH. - Malachi 4:1',
  'L8B32':
      'You will trample the wicked, for they will be ASHES under the soles of your feet. - Malachi 4:3',
  'L8P33':
      'The wicked will be completely consumed. You may read some of the terrifying things written by men describing the eternal torment of the wicked in the fires of hell. But the Bible clearly teaches that the lost will be utterly destroyed. Jesus says in John 3:36 that the lost "will not see life." The punishment for sin is eternal death—the second death—from which there is no awakening.',
  'L8P34':
      'To make a complete end of sin, God must destroy sinners. God is a God of love, and He takes no pleasure in the eternal torment of the wicked. It is unreasonable to eternally torture the lost. Some of the lost were truly evil, while others simply neglected to accept Jesus as their Savior. Is it fair to torment all of them eternally in the fires of hell?',
  'L8Q35':
      '8. What will happen to the fire that cleanses the world of sin and sinners?',
  'L8B36':
      'Behold, they will be like stubble; the fire will consume them; they will not escape the flame: IT WILL NOT BE A COAL to be warmed by, nor A FIRE to sit before. - Isaiah 47:14',
  'L8P37':
      'No fire or glowing embers will remain—the wicked will be completely destroyed. David adds:',
  'L8B38':
      'But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be like the fat of lambs: THEY SHALL VANISH INTO SMOKE: THEY SHALL VANISH AWAY. For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; YES, you will diligently consider HIS PLACE, but IT SHALL NOT BE FOUND. - Psalm 37:10, 20',
  'L8Q39': '9. How will God erase our memories of the painful past?',
  'L8B40':
      'And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain: for the former things have passed away. - Revelation 21:4',
  'L8P41':
      'How good God is. His heart aches for the lost. In His loving mercy, Jesus will take the great handkerchief of compassion and wipe away the tears. He will erase the sorrowful memories of the past. In Isaiah 65:17, we read that "the former things shall not be remembered, nor come to mind." And our verse says, "there shall be no more sorrow." The suffering of the lost will completely end.',
  'L8S42': 'A GOD OF LOVE',
  'L8Q43': '10. How does Jesus feel about the destruction of the lost?',
  'L8B44':
      '"Say to them, As I live, says the Lord God, I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN THE DEATH OF THE WICKED, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn back, turn back from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?" - Ezekiel 33:11',
  'L8P45':
      'Remember, no one will be destroyed unless they reject the opportunity to be saved. Jesus will save all who accept Him as their Savior, but He cannot save anyone in their sins. Those who knowingly cling to sin must pay the penalty—the second death.',
  'L8Q46': '11. What terrifying moment is coming?',
  'L8B47':
      'For it is written: "As I live, says the Lord, EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW TO ME, and EVERY TONGUE SHALL CONFESS TO GOD." So then each of us shall give account of himself to God. - Romans 14:11-12',
  'L8P48':
      'It will be a dreadful day when the wicked stand before the Judge and see the face of Jesus, whom they neglected, ignored, or even despised. Jesus gave every effort to save them. Finally, in shame and without excuse, they will bow and confess: "Jesus Christ is Lord, and He is righteous!"',
  'L8P49':
      'Remember, no one will be destroyed unless they reject the opportunity to be saved. Jesus will save all who accept Him as their Savior, but He cannot save anyone in their sins. Those who stubbornly cling to sin must pay the penalty—the second death.',
  'L8Q50':
      '12. Since the world will be completely cleansed of sin, how should we live today?',
  'L8B51':
      'Since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in HOLY CONDUCT AND GODLINESS? Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, BE DILIGENT TO BE FOUND BY HIM IN PEACE, WITHOUT SPOT AND BLAMELESS. - 2 Peter 3:11, 14',
  'L8P52':
      'God is about to ignite the dreadful filth of sin in this old world. He will cleanse the earth—even the very memory of sin. Wherever sin is found, it will be destroyed. Jesus earnestly pleads with you to turn away from sin so that you will not be destroyed in the end.',
  'L8Q53': '13. Who will be kept out of heaven?',
  'L8B54':
      'And nothing UNCLEAN, nor ANYONE WHO PRACTICES ABOMINATION OR LIES, shall ever enter it; but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life. - Revelation 21:27',
  'L8B55':
      'And if anyone’s name was NOT FOUND WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE, he was thrown into the lake of fire. - Revelation 20:15',
  'L8P56':
      'Will you surrender all your sins and give your heart to Jesus today? No heart stained with sin will enter. Let Jesus free you from sin and write your name NOW in the Book of Life. Will you say, "Jesus, I surrender all"?',
  'L8S57': 'NEXT LESSON',
  'L8P58':
      '"Where Are the Dead?" You will cherish every word of this amazing lesson. Where are the dead now? Do the dead know what is happening on earth? Are the dead in heaven? Can we communicate with the dead? Everyone must study the next lesson.'
