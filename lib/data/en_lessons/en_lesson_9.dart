  'L9T1': 'Where Are the Dead?',
  'L9M2':
      'I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he dies, yet shall he live. - John 11:25.',
  'L9P3':
      'We have studied how sin entered this world and how it brought sickness and death. You will remember that Satan lied to Eve in the Garden of Eden when he said, "You shall not surely die." (Genesis 3:4) Even today, Satan tries to make us believe that when a person dies, they do not truly die.',
  'L9P4':
      'Jesus tells us in our memory verse that people do die but promises they will live again. If we look into the Bible to study where the dead are, we read the words of Jesus, who knows and will resurrect the dead.',
  'L9Q5': '1. What do people fear the most yet understand the least?',
  'L9B6':
      'But man dies and fades away; indeed, he breathes his last, and WHERE IS HE? IF A MAN DIES, SHALL HE LIVE AGAIN? - Job 14:10, 14.',
  'L9P7':
      'More than anything, death is feared because few people understand what it is and what happens to someone when they die.',
  'L9P8':
      'Many religions outside the Bible teach that when a good person dies, their spirit goes to some good place. As you read these Bible verses, you will be sure of what happens in death; you no longer need to be confused or worried. How grateful we should be that God has given us the Bible to answer these difficult questions. Let us hold on to the Bible as our guide and believe what it says.',
  'L9Q9': '2. Where do the dead rest until the resurrection day?',
  'L9B10':
      'Do not marvel at this: for the hour is coming in which all WHO ARE IN THE GRAVES shall hear His voice and come forth—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation. - John 5:28, 29.',
  'L9P11':
      'This is a very important verse, directly from the lips of Jesus. He tells us that the dead are in their graves and will remain there until they are called to the resurrection, which will happen at His second coming.',
  'L9Q12':
      '3. According to Job, do the dead need to be awakened from their sleep?',
  'L9B13':
      'So man lies down and does not rise: TILL THE HEAVENS ARE NO MORE, they will not awake nor be roused from their sleep... If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, till my change comes. - Job 14:12, 14.',
  'L9P14':
      'The dead lie in their graves and will remain there until the clouds part at Jesus\' second coming. Job had full faith in the resurrection of the bodies of the dead. He says:',
  'L9P15':
      'But as for me, I know that MY REDEEMER LIVES, and HE SHALL STAND ON THE EARTH AT THE LAST: And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I SHALL SEE GOD; whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. - Job 19:25-27.',
  'L9P16':
      'Job looked forward to the "last day" when his Redeemer would come to wake him. He hoped for the resurrection, that he would again have a living body and see God. What a wonderful hope indeed! (A clear picture of how the bodies of the dead will be brought to life again can be found in Ezekiel 37:1-14.)',
  'L9S17': 'ARE THE DEAD IN HEAVEN NOW?',
  'L9Q18': '4. How does David explain that the dead are not yet in heaven?',
  'L9B19':
      'The dead DO NOT PRAISE the Lord, nor any who go down into silence. - Psalm 115:17.',
  'L9B20':
      'FOR IN DEATH THERE IS NO REMEMBRANCE of You; in Sheol, who will give You thanks? - Psalm 6:5.',
  'L9P21':
      'These verses clearly state that the dead are in their graves and not in heaven praising Jesus.',
  'L9Q22': '5. Long after David’s death, what did Peter say about him?',
  'L9B23':
      'Brothers, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand." - Acts 2:29, 34.',
  'L9P24':
      'The Bible says that David was a man after God’s own heart (Acts 13:22), yet David is not in heaven; he is in his grave.',
  'L9S25': 'DO THE DEAD HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS?',
  'L9Q26': '6. What happens to a person’s mind when they die?',
  'L9B27':
      'His breath departs, he returns to his earth; on that very day HIS THOUGHTS PERISH. - Psalm 146:4.',
  'L9B28':
      'There is no... knowledge or wisdom in Sheol where you are going... Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; for the living know that they will die, but THE DEAD KNOW NOTHING. - Ecclesiastes 9:10, 6, 5.',
  'L9P29':
      'You should always remember these two verses. They clearly explain what happens in death: (1) The breath (sometimes called the spirit) leaves—the person takes their last breath, (2) they are buried and return to dust; (3) on that very day, their thoughts perish; (4) in death, there is no memory of the past; (5) "the dead know nothing."',
  'L9Q30': '7. To what does Jesus compare death?',
  'L9B31':
      'After that, he said to them, "OUR FRIEND LAZARUS HAS FALLEN ASLEEP; but I am going there to wake him up." His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better." However, Jesus had been speaking about Lazarus\' death, but they thought he meant natural sleep. So then he told them plainly, "LAZARUS IS DEAD." -John 11:11-14.',
  'L9P32':
      'Jesus said, "Lazarus is asleep," and then clearly stated, "Lazarus is dead." The Bible mentions fifty-four times that death is sleep.',
  'L9P33':
      'When a person lies down for a good night’s sleep, doesn’t morning seem to come in just an instant? When someone dies, all thoughts cease. When they awaken at the call of Jesus on the morning of the resurrection, it will seem like they were only asleep for a moment. The major difference between sleep and death is that only Jesus can awaken someone from the sleep of death. That is why we should listen to His voice now so that we can hear His voice on the day of resurrection.',
  'L9Q34':
      '8. The Bible’s teaching that the dead are unconscious is reasonable.',
  'L9P35':
      'Have you ever seen someone lose consciousness after being hit by a speeding vehicle? While lying on the street, completely unconscious, how much do they know? You would answer, "Nothing." Now, suppose a truck comes and runs over them, killing them—what are they thinking, and how much do they know? Some would answer, "After they die, they will know everything," even though when they were unconscious, they knew nothing. But the Bible says, "On that very day, their thoughts perish," "the dead know nothing." The dead are in their graves, resting in an unconscious sleep. No one who has died is in heaven now or suffering in hell.',
  'L9P36':
      'It is comforting to know that our loved ones who have passed away are not currently living in some spirit world watching over us. As we journey through life’s sorrows and heartbreaks, they are not witnessing our struggles. No, they are resting in their graves, waiting for the call of Jesus, the Life-Giver.',
  'L9S37': 'SPIRITISM',
  'L9Q38':
      '9. What strong warning was given against attempting to communicate with the dead?',
  'L9B39':
      'Let no one be found among you who practices divination or observes omens or is an enchanter or a sorcerer, or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead. For anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord. -Deuteronomy 18:10-12.',
  'L9B40':
      'A man or woman who is a medium or a spiritist must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads. -Leviticus 20:27.',
  'L9P41':
      'In biblical times, there were spirit mediums called sorcerers or magicians who pretended to communicate with the dead. This is one of Satan’s deceptions, even today, because God clearly declared that the dead are dead—that they know nothing and are not in heaven or any other spirit world. This deception is so dangerous and terrifying that God commanded the execution of spirit mediums.',
  'L9P42':
      'King Saul, the first king of Israel, was killed because he disobeyed God and sought to contact the dead through a spirit medium. (1 Samuel 28 and 1 Chronicles 10:13-14.) If someone pressures you to attend a séance or a spiritist gathering, DO NOT GO. The messages given by spirit mediums come from Satan’s fallen angels, not from the dead.',
  'L9S43': 'OUR HOPE IN THE RESURRECTION',
  'L9Q44':
      '10. Who alone can redeem us from death and the grave?',
  'L9B45': 'I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and HADES. -Revelation 1:18.', 
  'L9B46': 'Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. -John 3:36.',
  'L9P47':
      'Yes, Jesus alone holds the keys to the grave. If you believe in Him and follow His Word, you will have the assurance of the resurrection’s power and the promise of eternal life in heaven.',
  // 'L9S48': 'NEXT LESSON',
  // 'L9P49':
  //     'Our next lesson answers some of the most thrilling questions we will study. Why are there so many wars? Will wars ever end? Will any dictator ever permanently conquer Europe? What does the Bible say about Christ? When will the Battle of Armageddon take place?'
